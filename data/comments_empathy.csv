But whales aren't people, any more than a parrot or magpie is. Baleen whales seem pretty average for mammal intelligence (they nurse for a year or two before leaving mom, mostly living alone for life), while toothed whales are up there with elephants, great apes, parrots and corvids. 

Still, they definitely aren't people, and the talk about their brains was taken almost word for word from the animal rights activists in ""Blackfish"", who blatantly lie about everything to make a point. (Whales do have a part of their brain that we don't have... it's for echolocation.)

Whales aren't being killed like this today, only some countries kill small numbers for meat (then there is the massive dolphin slaughter in Peru, where they kill many thousands annually for SHARK BAIT).

"In regards to your other comment, I suspected you would say this. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but eating plants is scientifically proven to be more healthy than eating meat.

And it doesnt matter if it used to sustain us in the past, we live in a completly different time and with these overpopulated modern societies, the planet cant sustain animal based diets. And the difference with indigenous people is that they hunt their own food, just like the Na’vi do, BUT without any harm to the environment. But thats a completly different thing. You cant use that as an excuse to eat meat, grass fed or not.

And Alot of people actually dont do it right, more than you’d think.

"I think that the home tree, a plant.. being killed in avatar one was easily the most memorable and sad moment of the film. Just because a plant can’t talk doesn’t mean it doesn’t have the right to live lol. They are pretty important.

But do you get mad at killer whales for hunting other whales? Cuz they will kill them just to eat one part. No? It’s natural? Whoa. Do you get mad that wolves hunt deer? No, natural. Cool. But when humans eat food it’s suddenly a problem. That’s not the problem. The problem is that overpopulation is taking too much resources from literally everything that humans use, or eat. If 8 billion people start eating only vegan burgers and salad there is not enough land mass to even come close to supplying them with the daily nutrition that a human needs. FYI, the majority of humans already don’t get enough nutrition through their often limited resources.

So people like Cameron want more people to eat land based plants, which will undoubtedly lead to more deforestation of the Amazon, and the African rain forests, leading to wider climate change and droughts and suffering of humans, sea life, and others. 

The only “fix” the earth has is to get rid of several billion humans, via war, natural disaster, space colonization, etc. a staggering 3 billion people rely on seafood. Do you even begin to understand how much farm land, as well as water used it would take just to replace seafood? Let alone meats like cow, chicken, etc.

Deforestation of the amazon, climate change, droughts, human starvation, suffering of animals, ocean destruction.

Thanks for advocating mass deforestation, and increase in draining our lakes and rivers to water the massive increase in farms in a planet with 3 billion more people the land needs to feed . If you just take the 3 billion who now rely on seafood. Not the several billion more who eat land animals. 

There is currently somewhere around 4.6 billion acres of farmland. You are proposing more than quadrupling that amount of farm land to feed 8 billion people. There is roughly 15.77 billion acres of land total that isn’t mountains or desert. That isn’t enough land for people to both live in and farm. And also have trees. Sorry.

As for populations in some countries collapsing due to becoming wealthier you are right. However that isn’t going to stop the worlds population massively increasing. By 2035 we will have 9 billion people. By 2058 we will have 10 billion. That number is with populations falling in america to Europe. 

The overall population is rising. And will continue to do so. Most of that population increase will be from India and africa. Developing nations. 

Do you know over 2/3 of pastures used for livestock are unsuitable for agriculture. Do you know climate change is guaranteed to lessen the amount of land in the world you can grow crops vegetarians require for a healthy diet ? 

How much land do you think it takes to live healthy on a plant based diet? How much? 1 persons total land needed , not just what they farm, but what they buy as well. Do you know? It is 2 acres minimum. What is that times 8 billion people? Please let me know. :) because I already know. There wouldn’t be enough land in your theoretical solution. There is not 16 billion acres of farm land that can grow all the crops needed. 

No spin on earth changes that.  Keep living a fantasy though where you focus on land meat instead of considering the impacts of 3 billion people stopping JUST seafood, which is entirely unrealistic anyways. People aren’t going to stop eating cows chickens , or seafood. So your argument is utterly meaningless.

In early 2009 I had recently moved out of my mother’s house because it had become an increasingly toxic environment, and I held onto the hope that moving in with my father and his new fiancé, would be a fresh start. It wasn’t. The refuge I sought became it’s own nightmare as feelings of welcome changed to outright rejection, and it was all too clear I wasn’t a person my father was willing to accept. My existence and who I loved was in his mind a betrayal. So all through the gaslighting and verbal abuse, I just kept my head down, burying myself in work and studies to get through. It was a time of survival. Yet, still, I blamed myself and questioned my apparent inability to live happily with either parent, and that maybe the problem for being unable to find stability was me. Well, at around this time, the rumor mill was in full swing on what James Cameron’s newest venture would be after 12 years.

Before my mother’s house, I had been raised by my Grandmother (I call her “Nanny”), an incredibly caring woman, who was as lovable as she was unorthodox, and as such, we’d gleefully watch Aliens and Terminator on television together. Cut to several years later, and Titanic would find me bawling my eyes out in public, then immediately becoming my favorite film. So from the time Avatar was announced to when I was sitting in that theater seat, I was beyond ecstatic! Here was finally something to hold onto, something that could cut through all the negative noise of my life, and remind me of those times just hanging out with Nanny on the couch watching blockbusters.

I’ve been living on my own for about 8 years now. I’ve worked my way through school and multiple jobs and now I have a career. And when December 16th finally rolls around, you better believe I’m going to be one of the first in line, and standing right by my side will be my 80 year-old grandmother, my Nanny, just as jittery and gleeful as I am! This is our film as much as it’s everyone else’s. This isn’t some generic tale about surviving oppression, this is my story, your story, an escape from hardship and an example of persevering against it, for anyone who was ever told they weren’t good enough, told they were betraying what someone wanted them to be, and for those who never thought they’d survive in the face of violent opposition.

It’s not within me to deny a film’s faults, no film is perfect, but let me tell you, that a sci-fi movie with blue aliens spoke to me in a way that few real people had, in a way that told me I was valid, and told me I was seen.",6,i8jzm3x,Avatar,t3_up5455,t3_up5455,1652515872.0

"Exactly this. Plus, I feel like the only way a white savior trope is offensive if they make it a point to say a white dude saved the day and the non-whites were too dumb, incompetent, or generally senseless to save themselves, and this incredibly offensive idea simply doesn't exist in Avatar. Jake is some disabled guy that gets a second chance after his world came crashing down around him because his brother died and he's missing a sense of family in his life. Jake's character isn't ""not charming"" because the actor sucks, he's odd and disenchanted because his bro is dead and he's having a surreal experience on a planet where the appearance of a new alien nature is distracting him from a few bad situations.  


The best part yet that these ""white savior"" people like to forget is that he was originally not a ""white savior"" but was 100% there to destroy the natives' way of life because his boss ordered him too. There was little good intention in him until he got closer to the people and slowly took on their way of life as his own. There is no white savior here, it's a damaged guy finding a new culture and way of life, and going so far as to fight for it, and he wasn't the only good fighter either, every na'vi there was going ham on the human forces.

"I think Neytiri's dislike of Spider, and humans in general, is pretty understandable. I mean... they blew up her home and killed her family, if an alien did that to me I'd be pretty fucking uncomfortable around them as well.  
I think her dislike to Spider specifically is a bit intense, even physically attacking him on multiple occasions (Not really including the part in the final battle, as she was just using him to save her daughter and likely didn't actually want to kill him, although I don't doubt she would if it *really* came to it). Out of all the humans to hate, with only the exception of his connection to Quaritch (Which is big, I get that, but he was very dead to Neytiri's knowledge through Spiders up bringing), he is the most unfair to hate. He was just stuck there, no choice on whether he could stay or not.  


I do agree that she's probably taking a pretty big step by allowing him in such close proximity to her kids despite her reservations. I will defend Neytiri to the death. If it were the trolley problem, but it was Neytiri and Spider, I'm sorry Spider but Neytiri is the one surviving those tracks.

Completely agree.Whenever people say Neytiri is ""racist"" against humans, they seem awful quick to forget that almost \*every\* experience she has had with them is horiffic. Aliens coming from another star, invading her world, slaughtering her son, her father, her sister, much of her entire clan and obliterating their home and their tangible, physical link to their loved ones, while also revelling in performing all of the actions that are explicitly and absolutely forbidden in Na'vi culture, right in her face.... so yes, she sees spider, and she sees the son of the man responsible for all of that. That fact she tolerates him (and other humans) as much as she does gives her the patience of a saint.

"Sigh...'Divine fatherhood' is nowhere to be found in reality. At least not now, not among ordinary humanity. Maybe the Great Father (Male counterpart of Universe/God) of Mysticism/Religions has it...

The instinct of fatherhood is also something to be doubted. Read history and browse Internet, then we would find that -

1. Man would mostly 'love' children of favored woman - even from her previous relationships. Or even kill biological children for appeasing the 'favored woman'. E.g. A father and his girlfriend have been sentenced to death in China after he threw his two children from his apartment building because his new girlfriend did not want another woman's kids. (The news is wide known in China, sentence copied from Dailymail)
2. Man would exchange children for better purpose, like power grabbing – e.g. Yi Ya steamed his son for Duke Huan of Qi; Many kings/emperors would kill already appointed heir for disobedience.
3. Man would intentionally produce children for his own interest, by enslaving/using other people (making them concubines/surrogate mothers), not for the purpose of soul of children him/herself. See Mitsutoki Shigeta, Elon Musk, Abraham (and Jacob? - he is claimed to love Rachel but won't refuse the maid servants and just slept with them) in Old Testament. 
4. Many fatherhood are in fact social constructs. In matrilineal/matriarchal societies/families they usually wouldn’t run to service if not formed a bond with mother or told to do so. Many (married) men are pretending to work overtime, but in fact playing online games at computer of work place, to avoid fatherhood duties today. Some young males are even boasting to learn the ‘Nigger Way’, to  ‘f**k and run’. (Yes, Chinese society is in fact really fueled with racism)

(I admit that in China, people’s overall morality are corrupted by totalitarianism/materialism, which can be traced about 2000 years ago. And males are more prone to corrupt by material forces. Reconnect to Divinity and destruction of CCP by external forces (there are almost no way to do this from ‘inside’) may work a bit)

Back to the film. I think the Recom Quaritch may be a different soul, burdened with another entity’s memory/social status. I have a feeling that Recom Quaritch is very different (but I still hope that the memory scanning tech just recall the soul – this is more ethical)
I can understand why Spider saved him – not for the blood, but for justice (Recom Quaritch saving him at least once) and for some newly made bonds with him.",0,j45f9vt,Avatar,t3_10alkpq,t3_10alkpq,1673596012.0

As a result, some sort of the kidnapping of children / main characters could happen like some of y’all are saying. As for the mcs specifically like Jake and the family, they can start rallying together the other tribes around Pandora, which would lead into a huge battle in 4.. The humans would be defeated once more but this time the characters “learn” from what happened between 1 and 2 with the humans coming back, and instead being the fight to them in 5. All while this happens, there will likely be an equal plot about the reality of Eywa, Kiris relationship with it all, etc., as the whole war thing seems to basic to constitute whole movies.. 5 will be made if avatar continues to sell, so I think they could technically “close it off” at 4 with a “complete” story, and not have to do the whole thing in 5 with Neytiri on Earth.",1,j2e5i1d,Avatar,t3_zzlzn5,t3_zzlzn5,1672503831.0
"I’ll give it a shot. They could be cut off from eywa or even resentful towards her. This lack of adherence to the same concepts as the other navi will allow the RDA to work with them much more freely at first. After the two have come to an understanding, the ash people will start their own conflict with the other clans, which much greater intent and ferocity than any of the past fights with humans. The RDA will eventually get spooked and try to reign them in, only to find they’ve created a monster and that they underestimated the ash people. The RDA would then be forced to leave the ash peoples lands behind, as they begin to conquer pandora.

Could add that once they are forced to leave, the RDA will separately engage in defensive operations against the ash people with an odd focus on protecting the planet, just to emphasize that they do need it, too. Maybe to add complexity and reinforce the idea that they have no interest in actually causing needless harm outside their actual specific resource extraction, all the while the ash people literally give no shits for the damage they do.

I legit think they could have a “draconian” thing going on with the volcanic region and it’s creatures. The sea people are very different from the forest people, so the ash people could be even more different. Maybe smaller eyes, bigger noses, and scales/plates on their tails, arms and legs. Probably a pale bluish color that looks grey.

Quaritch could have a similar relationship with the ash peoples more domineering nature to Jake and the forest people in the first film. It could be an interesting inversion.

"I agree with a lot of your sentiments, specifically with the underutilization of Neytiri. I would have loved an additional 30 minutes of content that showed her perspective in the first and second acts. 

One thing that keeps me from feeling disappointed, however, is Cameron’s description of Way of Water and the subsequent Avatar sequels as a ‘continuation’ of the first film. It’s the same story and there is more to come.

We are so used to movies attempting to tell their stories and hit their narrative points in a succinct and complete way. Everything needs to be wrapped up at the end, otherwise the audience won’t be satisfied with what they consumed. This likely is related to the typical reality of funding a project such as a movie and working within a limited budget and runtime with many hands at the controls.

However, Cameron owns his intellectual property. Disney only has distribution powers, and Cameron has shown he has control over the creation of Avatar films. He can make a 3-hour film, and include scenes that have no overt narrative point just to show off beauty and slice of life perspectives.

Therefore, he can take his time. Neytiri may have taken backseat this film to give space and emphasis on other characters. Perhaps in Avatar 3, Jake will have less focus instead. Cameron gets to play with a serialized style, and he’s described his approach as telling one big story over time. 

I expect we’ll see these narratives and characterizations play out throughout all the films, especially as Cameron’s Avatar sequels have been greenlit in the wake of TWOW’s success.

Whereas in the second movie he’s certainly more accepting of learning their ways (even if it is to use against them). Just feel like he’s shifting a little from his personality in the first film.

Also random side note, always saw Quaritch offering Jake his legs as a way to try and keep him loyal to Quaritch. And the only reason he offered Jake his legs back when he did was to try and get him out of the way cus he saw Jake was getting in deep with the Na’vi, that’s why he’s so angry when Jake refuses cus that’s when he realises he’s lost Jake as a solider.

"Interesting theory. I totally understand, further supporting evidence is the electrochemical link between all the trees on Pandora. however, that would also make all the life on pandora part of the tree of souls, so ewya, if she is only a tech terraformer, would be driven to protect the whole planet, not just one piece. But the magnetic fields could cause a superconducting such as unobtanium to form in concentric rings dependant on the charge of the tree of would and the surrounding rock.

 I personally don't want to think of her as some sort of evil force but hey, personal opinion.

 I think the tree is more a representation of the whole planet rather than the singular place. It is a religious place and because the signs of ewya are so present in everyday life for the Na'vi I don't think that progression would change their cultural reverence for a deity that presents itself in such demanding and obvious ways. If you think of Pandora like an animal and the humans as tics or a bacteria, there would be no problem if there were a few causing minimal damages only a small portion of the organism, the immune system targets the threat and the larger organism would survive, but once the bacteria starts targeting larger and more important parts of the organism, let's say the brain (represented here as the tree of souls and similar trees) the immune system (the animals) kicks in full force. protecting itself and the symbiotic organisms.

Quaritch is on Pandora simply because he wants to fight, not because he cares about unobtanium or profit margin or anything like that.

"I think the vast majority of Earthlings are too busy living day to day in their hellworld to care at all, BUT:

There's a LOOOT of RDA soldiers and employees dying on Pandora all of a sudden, and a lot of friends and family back home who are going to wonder why. I'm sure it's always been a dangerous deployment but this will demand explanation.

There's no journalists on Pandora, but as long as there's a few doing their jobs on Earth it wouldn't take much to interview a few returning RDA people about what happened and realize that a battle that took place (unless there's a crazy NDA and new laws in this future). Word about a marine switching sides and fighting humans would leak out.

You can bet that with trillions of dollars at stake, they'll push the narrative that a soldier went traitor, turned the natives against humanity, and led a bloody terrorist insurgency against peaceful miners, scientists and their armed protectors.

Pay no attention to the fact that the conglomerate that owns that particular media empire also has significant investments in companies that contract with the RDA to build mechs, supply food, build ships in orbit. You get the picture.

Add the fact that our presence on Pandora is now about colonization on top of resource extraction, and now you've got the literal future of humanity at stake.

Although RDA don't really need to put that much of a spin on the story. Jake was tasked with negotiating with the Na'vi to get them out of Home tree. He failed at the task so catastrophically that not only did he not negotiate with them, he didn't even tell them about it until mere moments before the RDA were at the doorstep.

The main thing holding the RDA before back from going full cutthroat was public opinion back home. They can use Jakes betrayal and the subsequent building of Na'vi forces as leverage to sway public opinion. Which looks to have worked because when they arrive back they immediately go into a literal Scorched Earth tactic.

"I think a lot of information would be vague and limited until Parker and crew returned home and immediately became the most interesting people on the planet. 

I think the people would know what happened, but with a spin to portray the RDA as victims of unwarranted aggression by the Na'vi. Jake Sully would probably be portrayed as a traitor who riled the Na'vi up against the Humans alongside Grace, who would be a good scapegoat because she's already dead and they might still want to try talking to Jake at that point.

Hometree would be spun as a retaliation for the unjustified murder of RDA workers and soldiers at the dozers, which it was, but the murders would be hyped up, people would know the names of each soldier who died and their families: ""John Doe was a decorated Veteran, he signed up to help protect people, he loved Pandoran nature, and always volunteered for missions outside the wire to collect flora. He planned to use his money to help wounded veterans back on earth. He was tragically MURDERED by the Na'vi who attacked while he was escorting a roadbuilding team. In honor of him we will be paying out his salary to the causes he supported.""

The actual attack on Hometree would be portrayed as: ""We sent a force to demand the guilty who attacked our dozers be handed over for a fair trial, we knew it was them because the cheif's son led the raid as we determined from surviving camera footage. We saw their warriors heading to attack positions, while they held our diplomats as hostages. With negociations clearly impossible, and realizing what was going on, the Colonel RISKED HIS LIFE to try and clear the civilians out of what was going to become a bad situation by firing non-lethal gas and even holding fire as long as possible while he himself was under fire from arrows, that sounds non-threatening until you realize those are as long as a human and can punch through bulletproof glass. Finally, once civilians were clear he opened fire on the warriors."" 

The attack on the Tree of Souls would simply be put down as Jake Sully agitating and a completely justified pre-emptive strike, that only failed because of Na'vi trickery and because the Colonel and Parker hesitated to strike for too long allowing the Na'vi to build up manpower and animal power, because they didn't want to harm civilians and were still trying to make peace.

"The RDA would do everything it can to prevent the truth from leaking and most likely manufactured a fake story, they also probably have manufactured another for in case things do leak out that would paint the na'vi as aggressors.

In the case it doesn't leak, most people have probably too many problems in their lives to care about it more than ""oh this might makes things difficult economically and it will impact us in a negative way so I hope they'll fix it soon"" unaware of what's happening. Only the people already opposed to the megacorps would call bullshit right away and seek to discover what really happened, which would be very difficult.

If some elements do leak out, it will depend on how much is public knowledge. The RDA will try to paint him as a traitor (in a way similar to how real pro-RDA people on the internet slander him already) while the anti-corporate people will hail the na'vi, Jake and the humans who resist the RDA as heroes of an anti-colonialist and anti-corporate (and anti-capitalist for anti-capitalists) struggle against megacorps (although I would also see people argue about wether or not Jake is a white savior just like in real life, once again it will depend on how much knowledge gets to the public).

Amrita is collected humanely, from volunteer tulkun, those already culled by the herd for old age or aggressive behavior, or those hunted by the seafaring Na'vi, we help them secure their next meal and only take a small vial of foul-tasting brain-juice that they don't want anyways.

It's likely nobody even cares about the soldiers who died. They care that the only planet that can keep humans from dying out is now fighting and winning. Without Pandora they're ALL going to die, and to broker peace with the Na'vi and leave them alone would mean mankind must also accept the inevitable and die with dignity.

The likelihood that humanity has received anything close to the truth about the situation on Pandora is practically zero.

"The answer to this question would hinge on one question:

Is there a communication link between Earth and Pandora?

If so, who controls it?

My understanding is that there is such a communications link.  Indeed it's a superluminal link based on quantum entanglement.  This is hinted at in a couple deleted scenes in the first movie and is also the subtext of Quaritch's ""i got your corporate approval"" comment to Jake.

I strongly suspect that the comm link is not entirely controlled by the RDA but rather is dominated by them.  

(i.e., they basically decide what information goes through that link, not anyone else)

It's hinted that public opinion on Earth tends to favor the Na'vi, or at least that a lot of people are sympathetic to the Na'vi because they are a sentient species.

The Activist Survival Guide makes this explicit in that it strongly suggests there is an active, anti-RDA ""Resistance"" operating on Earth.  It's also said that this group has its own transmitter and receiver.

If so, they would be able to get information about what is going on over on Pandora and get it out to the public, at least in theory.

Now whether any of this is true is up to James Cameron, of course, but I strongly suspect we'll find out by Avatar 5 that a lot of people on Earth are indeed sympathetic to the Na'vi.

(and yes, I know the ASG isn't considered ""canon"" anymore, but that does not mean that all of it is ""non-canon"" because some of it might indeed still be canon)

Aside from the Whale Jesus Juice. That's the one thing I don't get.

It looks like it requires a lot of tech and man power to hunt these things down. Resources that could be better utilised elsewhere, building up the first Human colony ready for the full colonisation, which they're already behind work on.

Anti Aging feels like just a waste given that Humanity has cloning and mind transferal tech. We're never told how many people that anti aging juice will work for. Is it that entire bottle for one person, or does each person only need a drop?

I think it was just added last minute as the ""message"" about how shit humanity generally is. Killing them just for that juice and leaving the carcass which mirrors Whaling for Whale Oil.

Then you have Avatar 1 which mirrors the natural resources taken from Africa when it was colonised.

I'm willing to bet one of the Avatars will be about how Humanity introduces some disease, mirroring when Humanity discovered the new world and or Humanity attempting to Terraform the planet.

His behaviour and his attitude of trying to be and act exactly like the person he is cloned after means that at some point, he is going to question and that the basis of his personality will start to fall apart.

The original Quaritch was highly prejudiced. Had outdated beliefs and hated the navi. Now this clone of him is carrying his mission. What becomes of him if for example he does wipe out the Navi?. The government will likely kill him too, and him being essentially Navi, puts his personality at odds with his personality construct.  It's no longer ""back water man against Navi"".

"You have got a case of the avatar blues, many people have  experienced a sense of emptiness or depression even after watching avatar, it was a big thing when the movie first released. There really is no way to cure yourself of these feelings other than watching the movie again, or letting the feeling just fade away.",27,iqvwmb1,Avatar,t3_xughsf,t3_xughsf,1664806747.0
"It is crazy how similar I feel to you, I appreciate you opening up about your avatar blues because I am experiencing the same emotions my friend. I LOVE avatar, I am so connected to the rich colors it brings and love of nature but also the love the characters show for each other throughout the film. 

I myself to have been watching anything I can get my hands on, over and over, deleted scenes, interviews, random videos about news, anything about Pandora that could keep me in the world because just like you I am trying to fill this void.

I feel so similar to you, it is like I cannot focus on anything, everything is oblivious and I just want to be in the Avatar world. 

I cannot tell if it is deep sadness or joy, parts of me think it is both, Sadness knowing something I love so deeply and strong will never be real and joy because I have movies to fulfill that sorrow but sometimes it's not enough. I am happy to find some one that feels almost identical to what I feel. Part of my emptiness comes from the bond I see between Jake and Neytiri, as they are true companions not just hook ups. 

One thing that has helped though, that has given my emotions a sense of ease is looking at other avenues I can channel that energy into such as collecting the figures or comics they put out. I recommend looking at the two mega figs of Jake and Neytiri Banshees and their respective figures, its almost like you can recreate a tiny Pandora yourself which has given me some ease of emotion.

I do want to say thank you again for posting this because it has helped me not feel like such an outcast. If you ever want to talk more about it just let me know man, I hope we both start to feel normal as time goes on!:)",4,iqw27is,Avatar,t3_xughsf,t3_xughsf,1664809084.0
"Ok, so, I definitely know exactly what you're talking about.  The way I've always described it is as a ""bittersweet"" feeling.  Extreme happiness and extreme sadness all at once.  I personally think ""Avatar blues"" or ""Post-Avatar Depression"" don't really get to how intense the feelings actually are: they're so much more than depression or sadness, because there's a deep and pure happiness too.  So, the big question is, how to handle it.  I can't answer that, but what I can offer is what worked for me.  


Firstly, I attempted to deal with it by avoiding the trigger: I avoided everything AVATAR.  This is perhaps the worst thing I could have done for this.  It made the sadness worse, and it put the feeling on a pedestal for me.  So what I did was talk to my psychiatrist at the time about it.  This was shortly after I went to WDW to see the World of Avatar for the first time.  Her recommendation was to do the opposite: Enjoy it, allow yourself to go full immersion for a bit, *live* it if necessary.  That's how I found the Na'vi language community.  


I took some time off from school to really evaluate things (I had been falling behind for a bit due to unrelated ADHD that finally showed up as an issue).  That first week or so, I watched the movie almost every day, sometimes twice in one day.  I engaged heavily with the language and the community.  As I did that, something fascinating happened: the sadness disappeared and the happiness remained.  I think I subconsciously finally realized that, while it's a fictional world, it's ok to be immersed in it.  A lot of my feelings seemed to stem from ""I shouldn't be this obsessed or this emotional over something fictional"" but this is a lie.  It's ok to be emotional/empathetic.  It's ok to love something and it's ok to incorporate it into yourself in some way.  That's why I speak Na'vi, that's why I probably know more about Pandoran biology than Earthly biology, and that's ok.  

So, to summarize, the absolute worst thing to do is to avoid it (which doesn't seem like what you're doing).  If possible, I recommend taking some time to process these feelings, understand the root cause of them, and figure out how to incorporate that root cause into your real life.  For me, I love worldbuilding and immersive worlds, especially naturalistic ones.  So, I made a concerted effort to allow for some immersion in my free time (Na'vi, watching Avatar in a VR headset, reading about the world, etc.) but also am working on some personal shortcomings preventing me from enjoying nature fully.  These feelings tend to hint at some personal goal you really want to achieve, even if you don't know what that is yet.  IMHO, it is always worth taking some time to really think through what these feelings are indicating to you.  From my time in the community and speaking with others who have had similar feelings, I have found that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this: you have to really work on it, do some serious introspection, and figure out what it means to you.

If you want to process your feelings with someone, I would recommend a therapist, but also feel free to reach out to me either here or on Discord in DMs.  If you have questions or anything, let me know: this is something I've been seriously thinking about for like 15+ years now.

"Hey OP. Somehow, what you and some others have written here has resonated with me on a fundamental level. Hopefully this post doesn't come across as melodramatic, but I felt compelled to answer as truthfully as I can. What you have described as ""post movie depression syndrome ""is something that has effected me for a long time.

But similarly, it doesn't have to just be a film. It could be anything that for some reason seems to have connected with me on a personal level. I haven't been able to work out a reason for exactly what causes it.

I would call it a book hangover (which I think is a vaguely common term). Because engrossing myself in books of other worlds would draw me in so completely that I felt a profound sense of loss after finishing them. Like the things in my life that were otherwise important to me didn't matter anymore, because they weren't there. Weren't wherever my mind wished I was. But similarly to you, it wouldn't only be longing and loss. There would also be joy, sincerity and admiration to it. Like the feeling was now a part of me, and I was grateful to have experienced it so intensely despite it being a thorn I couldn't, or didn't want to pull out.

Usually, they'd last a number of days to a couple of weeks, and despite feeling both utterly empty, and completely obsessed - the feeling would start to wane over time. It would eventually leave my conscious thoughts but could still get briefly rekindled by a reread or rewatch. Or if hearing the soundtrack ""hit"" me in the right way.

With Avatar, the first time I saw it in 2009, it lasted about 3 years. It wasn't continuous, and definitely gradually subsided over that period. But it, and my reaction to it firmly occupied a place in my head for that time.

For my own reasons, I felt incredibly lonely at the time. And I latched heavily onto the relationship between Jake and Neytiri. Identifying strongly with Jake's reaction to seeing all that Pandora was (as is intended, he is a proxy for the viewer), and the overwhelming sense of wonder, beauty, belonging, and meaning he finds there.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this extended to how he felt about Neytiri. Her will, tenacity, and vulnerability. How someone could introduce you to a harsh but hauntingly beautiful landscape and culture, guiding you through it and their ways. Finding real love and companionship under the threat of existential devastation, and somehow prevailing against it together. Impossible, tramautic, but serene experiences that shaped who they were.

None of it happened to me, but the emotional intensity of it all was somehow indsitingishable from my own experiences, and they left their mark all the same.


Now, 13 years later I'm in a totally different place. A loving and long relationship, a good career, a house. I'm happy and content. I've had plenty of other ""hangovers"" since - without the intensity or duration and enjoyed the imprint and meaning they had as they waned.



***

Seeing Avatar in the 3D again was truly like returning to Pandora, and it felt like the reopening of some old, but treasured wounds.

It's very strange, being rationally content and happy, but with a craving to fill a sadness, a void caused by grieving for experiences you've never had.

It makes me want to run, to swim, to write - a desire to create something that I feel as strongly about - but the back of my mind rejects it thinking, ""but it won't be there with her, it won't be Pandora"". It feels a bit shameful to even think it.

My intuition says that this won't last nearly as long this time, but I guess I'll find out.

I'm rambling, so I'll leave it here. Part of this response was an exercise in catharsis for myself - but I hope you were able to make it some of the way through and that it could have helped in some small way.

"First of all friend, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to responding to me and to share your own experience with the Avatar blues ! 

It feels so heartwarming to know that there is people out there that love the movie, its world and characters and all the emotions they provide as much as I do. 

I especially liked you talking about how the main characters care for each other. This true, pure, selfless love hit me so hard when watching the movie ... Even if its not a romance centered movie, I can't remember being so mesmerized by a relationship before ..

I understand what you mean by saying that knowing this world will never be real and that we may never experience such a pure form of love makes you sad ... But I truly believe that there is good in this world too and that the movie also has to push us towards opening our eyes on the beauty that lies within it ! 

Also, don't gorget that 4 more movies are on their way ;) Even though I kind of fear them because in my mind, this world can't be considered without Jake and Neytiri's relationship, these two embodying the perfect symbiosis that is Pandora. 

I also have to say that I looked into merch/figurines but have not found anything great and affordable at the same time ! 

I do believe that we are not the only ones to feel this way and I'm really happy if my post helped you in managing this overwhelming feeling a bit (because yours did it for me:)). 

I'm sure time will ease things out even though waiting for The way of Water will be very hard !

I strongly agree with every thing you wrote and came to the conclusion that even though being happy with my life, I was craving for more life, more amazing moments with the people I love, more sincere relationships with others ... 

Ultimately, the main takeway from the movie in my opinion is that you should never settle on what you have and take it for granted because it kind of takes away what makes life so special, what prevents us from being open to every thing, to others, to let ourselves being amazed by what we see, smell, taste, touch, feel ?

There is no doubt that I've felt as powerfully moved about my own experiences too as they've happened - and thinking back there are lots of them - they just aren't at the forefront of my mind right now. 

And that's okay. As you said, we should never settle or take for granted what we have, and to keep appreciating, understanding, and seeking out ways to express our own lives as we go through them. The good and the bad. So for now whilst the feelings of loss are still strong with me, they can live in a sort of symbiosis with the rest of me and whatever else is to come.

">They do not have adequately armored glass for their helicopters

Here's a fun fact, neither do Apache helicopters or indeed, most attack helicopters. The Russian armored helicopters are the exception, not the rule of how well protected a helicopter is. There are physical limits on how heavy you can make a helicopter with a given engine for a given speed and fuel efficiency, and adding armor is often simply not considered worth it. It might be worth noting in the RDA's case that their helicopters were straight up winning the battle in the first movie despite being heavily outnumbered.

"The human are not trying to exterminate the Navis. Nor extensively destroy the biosphere by nuking it. They also do not want to radicalise Eywa and thus radicalise the entire biosphere and the psionic consciousness of the planet. The planet will then become unlivable for humans. In the first movie they tried diplomacy and appeasement and in the second movie they wanted to take out Sully to weaken the resistance. Its not an all out war which I think they can easily win albeit the economical and logistical obstacles but such a war would make the planet hostile and toxic.

Also colonising a planet requires huge amounts of economic resources and they are basically trying to fund the colonisation using the resources of the planet itself such as Unobtainium and Amrita. They want to weaken the resistance so that they can increase their wealth making potential by increasing the rate of wealth production which in turn will increase the rate of colonosation.",3,kqzwgmx,Avatar,t3_1atkfr2,t3_1atkfr2,1708269078.0
"The RDA's downfall could be attributed to a combination of factors. One possibility is that they underestimated the power and connection to nature that the Na'vi had with Eywa. Additionally, the Na'vi's knowledge of their own environment and skill in guerrilla warfare could have given them an advantage against the technologically advanced but unfamiliar tactics of the RDA.


It is also possible that the RDA's technology, while advanced, may have weaknesses or vulnerabilities that the Na'vi were able to exploit. Perhaps the RDA's weapons and defenses were not suitable for the harsh environment of Pandora, or they may have been overwhelmed by the sheer numbers and determination of the Na'vi and we see this in the final battle of the first Avatar movie. Also the Na'vi's knowledge of their environment and their ability to blend in with it makes it difficult for humans to use their advanced technology against them.",7,kqzf6zx,Avatar,t3_1atkfr2,t3_1atkfr2,1708261015.0

"> How the hell is it possible that they are defeated SO easily by beings who are barely in the stone age?

Because there’s this thing called “plot armor” where let’s say a regular man like Batman can go beat a literal demigod like Superman if the plot needs them to. Same thing applies here. Realistically the Na’vi stand no chance against humanity. But, James Cameron wants them to, so he writes the script in a way that they do. It’s as simple as that. Eg. Problem: I need to destroy the Na’vi’s Tree of Souls. 

Solution: Do I use the my attack helicopters’ speed to deliver a devastating volley like the one used on Home Tree? A quick strike without needlessly risking the lives of my men in a prolonged attack against a numerically superior foe in the one spot I can’t make full use of my superior weaponry? 

OR

Use the biggest, slowest ship I have to deliver a big bomb, and move in the slowest, tightest, possible formation allowing my enemy to ambush me and while at it, launch an inconsequential ground assault that achieves nothing but put more men in harm’s way?

Anyone would’ve chosen the first option, but, again, humans needed to lose, so he just makes them lose by choosing the second. It doesn’t have to make sense, it juste needs end *how he wants it* end.",4,kqyhga5,Avatar,t3_1atkfr2,t3_1atkfr2,1708237648.0

">Now other sources say his name is Javier

To be fair, every source besides the one Empire article. Still, them removing his full name on the Avatar website is a bit sus, but it might be simply because Spider is less of a ""nickname"" by this point and just what he goes by as opposed to his first and last name. Still, it lends credence to the idea that he has some wacko parentage or history, but honestly, I'm not sure I'd be that thrilled by that? It would feel like a lot on top of Kiri and her dealio, and I'd prefer that Spider be some nobody kid with no ties to any main characters. We need more heroes and main characters that are nobodies with no special lineage, no important parents, nada.

Again, it would just be throwing in a twist and feigned plot significance just for the hell of it, and I wouldn't be too much a fan. Plus it fails to consider the ""future lore"" of Avatar with ACE and the PCI. It's pretty much implied that the RDA are not going to see any sort of reform, they are going to be forcefully expelled from Pandora again and more benevolent human forces are going to take their place to bridge the peace with Na'vi and undo the damage caused by the RDA.

"I'm taking your post in good faith - I agree...somewhat. Avatar 1's strongest scenes imo were seeing the day-to-day operations of the RDA. The intro's inbound shuttle flight, the science team avatars flying via chopper into the jungle, then even the conversations between SecOps, Parker and the Science Team. There was an aura of mystery and fear that eventually gets cleared up with the plot. 

Now that the perspective kinda shifts in Avatar 2, we have to rely on Spider for that same perspective. The 'expedition' factor is kinda lost. When I say Avatar 2 needed more RDA scenes, it's not killing, but I would've loved to see the Pandora through the eyes of the Recoms, new RDA personnel or even the whalers. Some 'guns down' character development would've made the Colonel's side more intriguing imo. 

My only counter-point to your post, is so many fans (and critics) want Avatar to be Halo or 40k or even Aliens. And while the human perspective is cool - that's not Avatar, and Cameron doesn't want to make it 'fit in' as a military scifi experience. So I understand the backlash, so many insist Avatar be like the 100s of vidoegames where humans show up to shoot aliens.

Neytiri definetely wouldnt forgive him, she didn't like him to begin with and I feel that finding out about him saving Quaritch would be her ""I told you"" moment with everyone else.

on the one hand, he has always kind of accepted spider and acknowledged his having a foot in both worlds, and so sees himself in him somewhat, but after the fight in ATWOW with quaritch (which jake only partook in to get rid of the threat he would forever pose to the sully family), spider’s decision will definitely be a significant blow and damage his trust of him. the fact that spider concealed this decision from them only exacerbates the problem, and definitely won’t help his case. i expect spider to be somewhat ostracised in the next films when the sully’s find out.",12,k4jg60g,Avatar,t3_175ya2n,t3_175ya2n,1697103068.0

I can see how she would be motivated to go through with that if she found out Spider let Quaritch go. Another thing is that if Spider flat out killed Quaritch, it would make him just as bad as any other murderer.

"You’re all good my friend! Thanks for the kind words :) In the last few years especially, I’ve grown to love Avatar more and more, not just because the film unto itself stands the test of time, but it is **the** antithesis of so much of the conveyor-belt-made, essentially message-less, hollow, creatively tepid films that are being made nowadays (I don’t think I need to name names, I’m sure you know what I’m talking about). 

Thinking of the sequels being on their way gives me comfort — it’s not outlandish to say that many of us, particularly younger people, take their cues of how/who to be from art and entertainment, and Avatar’s lessons could help ensure the upcoming generation gets off on the right foot.

Cameron realises that he has a responsibility, as a human being and an artist to himself, and as an entertainer and educator to the audience, to ensure the film becomes the best/truest version of itself possible.

Money is of course a necessary consideration, but it’s a means to and end for Cameron, 

whereas for sooo much of the committee-assembled drivel that have been on screens lately, money was **by** far the overriding motivation. 

It’s so transparent to see the sheer gulf of difference between Cameron and other, I’ll just say it, Disney filmmakers nowadays — and while I’m glad the company appears to be committed to the sequels,

I won’t entirely credit the Mouse House with them getting greenlit — they clearly want quick turnovers, if you look at their other properties. So who made it happen? I’ll tell you who:

I think Cameron *stormed* (Lightstormed, if you will) into those offices after the Fox purchase and said ‘Love some of your past work, and overall I’m happy with the partnership (World of Pandora), but when it comes to these four films, I don’t give a fuck if you’re the owners now. I’m not rushing these films for your quarterly statements — you will let me release these films when and *only* when they’re ready, and we won’t have any problems. Mess with that in *any* way — if you so much as try to shift those plans, give Avatar any kind of short shrift or rush us, anything like that — and you’ll always be known as the company that lost this project.’

I can’t be the only one who sees the slight incongruity of Avatar being allowed all this time to be made, while other Disney projects have to skip along to their schedules and financial projections like clockwork. 

That’s the power of Cameron’s conviction and clout.  

So far at least, relations between the natives (the Avatar crew/cast) and the RDA (Disney) seem to be amicable.",3,g14r7au,Avatar,t3_i7w4lm,t1_g14jt28,1597173341.0

"Neteyam is trying to be the responsible big brother and Lo'ak keeps enticing him to participate in dangerous moments, i.e. when they abandon their post as spotters during the train heist. Neteyam comes clean with how little he did to stop Lo'ak, meanwhile Lo'ak acknowledges it was his idea to begin with; Jake tells Neteyam to have a tighter grip on his younger brother, and he also tells the younger brother that his actions have consequences and one of those could have been the death of Neteyam. He is holding them both to a standard of responsibility and protecting one another, and this is seen later when Neteyam does stand up for his little brother whilst he fights the other Metkayina boys, but Jake tells him that yeah, you did the right thing sticking by him, but you can't continue to take the blame for Lo'ak when he is the one making these dumb decisions. When Lo'ak goes to save Payakan, putting himself at risk, Jake immediately rushes to save him, and it isn't until after Neteyam's death that he really blames Lo'ak for his actions, saying ""You've done enough."" when he offers to help rescue his sisters, basically naming him for having killed his brother. Lo'ak pursues Jake through the wreckage of the ship and confronts his father about how to swim out. Jake tells him that he needs to save himself, saying he won't leave him behind. Lo'ak recites the ""Way of Water"" to his father, talking about how to slow his breathing down, how to cam himself down, how to stop worrying, how to ""go with the flow"", how to not get carried away in the chaos. The breathing technique discussed throughout the film, I wouldn't be surprised if it was all just a metaphor for controlling your emotions when you're presented with a really high stress situation; ""just breathe"". Jake is about to give up because he is running out of air and knows his limitations, he knows he won't be seeing his family again, and so he tells Lo'ak to leave. In Lo'ak's refusal to leave and his speech to his father, Jake learns that if the family is going to get through all of the strife and conflict they've been through, he has to be willing to ""just breathe"", to calm himself in order to make the best decision he can.

"I think it's a great dramatic beat that he feels at times more like a captain than a father to his sons. This is something he can grow from (he already does by the end, but I think there's more growth to happen, a larger overall arc), and it makes sense to me that someone who had such a purpose-less life before he landed on Pandora, isn't going to immediately become the perfect dad, and his military coding is still very much a part of his DNA (figuratively, lol...). Plus add in how they've now been sprung into a war, it kinda fits.

I don't know why I didn't see it before, but I think Neteyam being on the periphery almost telegraphs his death, but I was still shocked. People in my cinema were really upset by it, you could feel it in the air. A very powerful moment. I get people not feeling attached, but I'd like to think that the movie makes you attached to the -family- and he comes along with that. He's portrayed as the kind of perfect eldest child, the apple in the eye of the father. So in a way, there's not much growth for a character like that, whereas Lo'ak has a lot of potential to have an interesting story.

No it matches perfectly. Tsutey hated Jake from the beginning. Even before he mated w neytiri.

Jake’s children are hybrids w some human features so there’s a very strong case that their existence might be even more bizarre than Jake himself to the reef people.

My friend they’re kids it ain’t that deep are you thinking the Navi never mess around with one another? Frankly you’re projecting this whole tv drama comparison onto the movie. No shit them making fun of her was silly. No shit them bullying each other was silly. that was literally the whole point. And that’s pretty realistic.

"Well, the Na’vi mate for life. As such, it’s considered a very serious commitment. Being mated is like being married, and being “engaged” to marry for life is a pretty big deal. Breaking it off is therefore serious business. Even more so when you consider that Neytiri was meant to be the next Tsahìk alongside Tsu’tey as leader of the Clan, in a sort of spiritual-political agreement. You can hear the shock and condemnation in Mo’at’s voice as she demands to know whether or not Neytiri has committed such an act, while anger is clearly visible on her face. “*Is this true*?” (Even Grace says “Oh shit!”) She has basically forsaken her duty to her people and her future “husband” *in the eyes of her clan.* The feeling of shock and horror only passes as Jake turns the clan’s attention to the more pressing issue at hand and makes his speech that he is not the enemy, that “the enemy is outside, and they are very powerful.”",3,j3oqom5,Avatar,t3_107s0ju,t1_j3ol6w2,1673312167.0

"He and Neytiri were more duty bound to be mates in the eyes of the people since she became the next in line tsahìk-in-training when her sister died. It seemed like she didn’t really feel much for him except respect and friendship…maybe even more brother like love if she grew up with him and her sister liking each other. We really don’t know how the relationships are chosen for the leaders or how much say the kids have in the matter.

I’m not sure what made him stand out to her family except being the best warrior of the tribe and they originally arranged him to mate with Neytiri’s sister who died. “Sylwanin was the daughter of Eytukan and Mo'at, the older sister of Neytiri, and Tsu'tey's fiancé. She was a member of the Omatikaya clan and a tsahìk-in-training.” We don’t learn much about her in the movies and what was there was left on the editing room floor.

He was definitely more on the arrogant side and quicker to anger. He has more hate towards the humans because they killed someone he loved and attacked his home. He cares deeply for his people though and overall I’d say he has more maturity than the new water tribe boys since he’s older and more experienced.",5,j3pza46,Avatar,t3_107s0ju,t1_j3oqom5,1673334161.0

"1. They know what happened and how it happened. It's just that for them, leading a group of people to their death, even for a good cause, is the same as killing them which is reasonable to a certain point
2. They wouldn't have had the occasion to connect with Payakan since a Na'vi would only do that to make a lifetime bond with the animal. But either way they know that Payakan didn't actually murdered those Na'vi s, he just led them to battle where they met their own deaths.",9,j0tzc7d,Avatar,t3_zpou4z,t3_zpou4z,1671451516.0
"I love the culture and have no issues with it

In the movie, he lead a little revenge group to attack the rda, and *more* na'vi and tulkun lost their lives as a result. So he is (indirectly) responsible for these added deaths. It doesn't matter how you and I feel, these creatures have a strict pacifistic doctrine that he broke, and he had to face the consequences.

They kill to survive (to eat) and nothing more. That's why neytiri got mad when all those viperwolves had to be hurt or killed to save Jake. It's disruptive to the balance/navi way of life. But I agree, it is odd that they didn't pray or anything, perhaps this is taught to older children?? Or maybe they neglected to teach the children because they were too focused on other matters? Either way, I hope this isn't a problem in the sequels 


I don't think it was out of place at all. These children were raised by a previously human father, they'll pick up some slang from him and the other humans/avatars at the science base.

(I'm not 100% sure, but this is what I took from the movies)


I do agree with your comments about the movie lacking some well needed qualities.",4,j0ua0ji,Avatar,t3_zpou4z,t3_zpou4z,1671457921.0
"Yeah, the bickering and bullying among the kids was a bit too familiar. Even with Jake’s influence, these are Na’vi born in the jungle through and through. And the scenes with the Metkayina bullies were extremely derivative from like every “new kid on the block being picked on” trope ever. I felt like I was watching a bad highschool drama most of the time.

Don’t get me wrong, I like the movie. But why would an ancient alien species behave exactly like juvenile humans…especially when the first movie did a decent job at setting up the fact that they were similar but still, well, alien. I just wish the world building was more consistent between the two films. 

And the fishing scene did stick out as odd, both with young Neteyam and Lo’ak later beyond the reef. In both instances they kill a creature and there was none of that reverence that was so important to the culture in the first movie. Why make such a huge deal out of that in the first film then??",3,j0u30a6,Avatar,t3_zpou4z,t3_zpou4z,1671453945.0
"I also didnt understand the thing about payakan at first. Im thinking it might have something to do with whales in real life and what they symbolize. They are pretty much the most peaceful creatures on earth. They are refered to as ”gentle giants”. I have a feeling that was an inspiration behind the ”tulkun way”. And regarding payakan being an outcast, maybe it was a way to symbolize that other species can be outcast from their pack/family. And just like humans, they can make mistakes or fight for something even if its not their ”natural order of things”. To give you an example of this in the real world, imagine a wolf part of a pack, befriending a human. The other wolves of the pack wont accept the human, which makes the other wolf fight his pack to protect his human.

And regarding the fish in the beginning, it does not show any unessecary killing - like the viperwolves in the first movie. The fish is being killed to be eaten, the Na’vi ”borrow” it for food, but will return the energy. Its not like humans, that simply take and take and doesnt give anything back. 
The viperwolves on the other hand are killed simply for defending themselves and their territory. Jake cant see this and dont know how to evade the situation, which forces neytiri to intervene, and at that point its too late to turn it around. 

I also think the Na’vi is ”humanized” so we can relate to them more. They are a humanoid species after all. If they werent, im not sure the bigger audience would enjoy the movie in the same way. And the message told in the movie would not get through as easily. The movie is basically about us, about human greed and what its doing to the planet. Theres no other movie like it",3,j0u71p6,Avatar,t3_zpou4z,t3_zpou4z,1671456335.0
"Yeah, I do agree that the whole way of tulkuns thing makes no sense. Long before the movie (but once I've heard about the concept) my first thought was, what about feeding? Do Metkayina only eat plants because they can't kill even a fish? During the movie I thought that Metkayina kids tricked Lo'ak into hunting a fish to make HIM an outcast, but apparently that wasn't the case.
My guess was, maybe they only hesitate from killing highly intelligent species like themselves and tulkuns? But then they go into a battle against tulkun hunters and kill them. For revenge - but Tonowari himself said that even justified killing is forbidden. Unless they don't consider humans being equals when it comes to morality and killing, I too think it's a giant plot and world-building hole.
Also, Neteyam makes his first kill as a kid - while according to Avatar (and one deleted scene that enhances it), you can't make a kill unless you're permitted and ready to become a taronyu. Unless Neteyam went to tame a banshee that very moment, as a 5-year-old or so, or unlees Na'vi consider fish an unprivileged animal (kinda like humans do, like vegetarians do accept fish meat), again, I don't see how it makes sense.
I feel like Cameron and world-makers idealized Pandora and Na'vi too much for the sake of the 1st movie and now they try to back off, to make the story believable and moving forward. I think that not much plot could be written with the perfectly-perfect and ideally spiritual species, they have to have flaws. Which is believable. But at the same time I'm annoyed with the books and all official concepts and lore info stating how pure Na'vi are, knowig all the flaws we're discussing here. I really look forward to Avatar 3, where there are supposed to be evil Na'vi. It contradicts their purity so much that I'm deeply curious of how Cameron deals with the explanations.",5,j0tz450,Avatar,t3_zpou4z,t3_zpou4z,1671451353.0
"To the Metkayina, Payakan leading an assault against the human forces was a violation of the Tulkun way, that being how killing only brings more killing; agree with it or don't, that is what the Tulkun and Metkayina believe. This does call into question them killing the RDA at the end of the movie, but that's another discussion entirely. Payakan's actions doomed the lives of countless Metkayina and Tulkun, which is why he is considered an outcast; the attack on the RDA was seen as not only futile but also a violation of the Tulkun way, that killing only brings more killing.",2,j0u07e0,Avatar,t3_zpou4z,t3_zpou4z,1671452108.0

"Ok, then I misunderstood that but still. Thats barbaric. It doesn't make sense with all the interconnectedness that Eywa is supposed to invoke in every living being on this planet. Again, they stated multiple times how the planet was spiritually connected. How do you justify this cruel resentment at an animal who was just trying to make a difference? Thats down right cold hearted. And I distinctly remember them calling him a murderer and the younger brother, who had a connection with the outcast, trying to convince everyone that the whale was in fact not evil.   
It is just not well thought out.  


And point 2, yeah sure, I get that. But it seems a bit weird that no one would've tried to sympathize with this beings who are SO intelligent and emotional. I highly doubt that no one would've tried. Unless - of course- they acted as if he was a serial killer, some kind of demon almost that you shouldn't cross paths with, which they did.   


So yeah whats up with that...",1,j0zth7c,Avatar,t3_zpou4z,t1_j0tzc7d,1671556461.0
"Well the whale was potrayed in the movie as some kind of monster. The kids were afraid of him. Remember how the youngest was trying to convince everyone he was not a bloody murderer?  


And I can believe that they kill for food, but I don't believe a single second that they would be so careless killing them. Every living being is connected to Eywa. Why would they care for all the animals they don't eat, but laugh and praise killing animals designated to be eaten? Thats speciesism and I thought the message of the move was specifically that that is bad.  


Why would they use that slang while talking na'vi though? I understood in the beginning that they were gonna show us their language in english so we wouldn't have to read subtitles. I don't think that Jake managed to full on and single handedly americanize the whole language. Everyone speaks like they come from america. And its not just the ""bros"" its everything.

"The way they treated payakan was outright brutal and cruel. I don't buy that a species that is so deeply connected to their planet via Eywa would do something like this. Nah-ah.  


I didn't say it was unnecessary. I said it doesn't make sense that they would celebrate it and laugh and smile while doing it. They showed multiple times that they care for any being, no matter how small, because they all are connected. So at the VERY LEAST they should be respectful while killing, understanding that they ENDED someone. Being appreciative for the life that was sacrificed for them. Everything else is non-sensical. They can't pick and choose when they are compassionate to the point of crying their heart out and when they suddenly dont give a f.  


And if Cameron wanted to humanize them so one could relate more, why did he do a movie about a goddamn alien species in a far far away planet and set up everything to emphasize that they are NOT like us. They are much more connected to nature, much more sensitive, much wiser in that sense and simultaneously way more primitve ( with not so much of a negative connotation I have to add). So yeah...

Not killing is the Tulkun way, not the Metkayina way. The metkayina hunt for meat and fight as warriors when needs be. It is the Tulkun who do not kill, no mather how justified (and that law is mainly for non-prey, meaning Navi and other tulkuns).
