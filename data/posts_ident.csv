Why is Kiri considered Mute?,72,wrlxi2,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/wrlxi2/why_is_kiri_considered_mute/,24,"I'm hearing people talk how this theory is being taken as cannon and wondering why. So my sister and I have been compiling together all the reasons why we think Kiri is most likely mute to clear things up.

**Outside Confirmations**

+ CJ Jones, a deaf actor was [hired to create a na'vi sign language.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/122993065/avatar-hire-renowned-deaf-actor-cj-jones-to-create-sign-language) It'd also have to accommodate a four-fingered peoples. There's been speculation Cameron intended this solely for underwater communication however all Cameron said was,

>“We did a scene last week with six teenagers, well, actually five teenagers and one 7-year-old underwater holding their breath for a couple minutes and acting, actually doing a dialogue scene under water because they speak kind of a sign language.”

He didn't outright say signing underwater was why he had it created. Cameron is a certified diver himself, he can easily come up with his own na'vi hand signs for inherently short dialogues underwater. Instead he commissioned the help of a deaf actor to come up with a brand new sign language with it's own syntax. If the signing is for diving, you ask a diver. If signing is for a disabled character, you ask a disabled actor.
CJ Jones is cast to play in the new movies but he's [not allowed to say who he's playing](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi4dDK4nds2/?hl=en). Why not? If it's to be the Metikayina translator which the IMDB assumes, what's the thinking? Why be tight-lipped about it? What better place to hide the secret that one of your leads is mute than putting the actor's coach in plain sight.

+ Sigourney Weaver, when asked about her role of Kiri, said she had to [learn how to act in a completely new way](https://mobile.twitter.com/avatarsequelsbr/status/1545892190106394625). She's playing a teenager but Sigourney doesn't need to learn how to act like a teen, she was one once; if anything she'd need a refresher as it's been fifty years. If she's playing a mute, then she'd need an acting coach on not only how to sign, but how to act with sign. In Guillermo del Toro 2017 'Shape of Water' Sally Hawkins plays Elisa, a mute woman. 

>“To make sure Hawkins got it right, the production hired two ASL coaches, one of whom was Amanda Richer, an actress, director, and producer.”

Hawkins had to train for months under Richer so she could play a convincing ASL signer. 
Not only does “The Shape of Water sound similar to “The Way of Water”, but Guillermo del Toro happens to be one of James Cameron's close personal friends; and buddy story-tellers love to bounce ideas off one another.

**Technical Reasons**

The voice issue. If Kiri is playing a na'vi teen on the cusp of adulthood, but played by a woman in her seventies, there are three options going forward if Kiri does speak.


+ Sigourney uses her own voice. There'd be a disconnect registering Kiri as young if her voice is old. Sigourney could do a voice but she's not a voice actress and for the roles she has lent her voice to, the range is much the same as her regular speaking voice. She always sounds like Sigourney, a woman who captures your attention through the authority in her tone. 

+ They modulate her voice. This might work for a speaking line or two but for four movies it'd get very old very quick. It'd alienate the audience from an already alien character.

+ The dub. Dubs have the disadvantage of vocal dissonance from the actors' performance, it can be done and done well but it's not ideal especially for a blockbuster saga. On top of that, no actress is listed as playing her voice. Maybe they're keeping it secret, okay why? They're not secretive about Kiri being played by Sigourney, so what's there to hide about a dub to bypass the voice issue? 

**Story Related Reasons**

+ Kiri is described as not being **prepossessing**; *impressive to others, esp. Immediately.* Sigourney's voice is impressive to others; the only way I see her playing the realistic role of a wallflower is if she talks little or not at all.

+ Kiri is also trying to find out who she is. If she doesn't know who she is then she doesn't know her own voice. This could be played up on a literal level.

+ If Kiri is mute, she'd have an affinity for being underwater for this would be the one world where everyone is rendered like her: unable to talk.

+ Jake's kids would already have to know sign in order to talk underwater with the Metkayina kids. So na'vi sign is universal for the same reason their speaking tongue is. The Metkayina have reason to use it more frequently than the Omaticaya yet it sounds like Jake's kids are well-versed in it already.

+ Kiri's movements and appearance is much like a woodsprite, or as the na'vi call it, 'Atokirina' A-T-O-**K-I-R-I**-N-A. Her connections to Eywa are already irrefutable but her physical similarities to the seeds of Eywa can't go ignored. Woodsprites are *silent*, harmless, pure spirits of the forest. So unassuming yet the moment one catches your eye it commands your attention, because how could you not be in awe for something so ethereal? Kiri, if she signs, will command the attention of the whole audience as they try and figure out what she's trying to say, just as the na'vi try to figure out what the Atokirina's are saying.

+ In a [shot of her with her family](https://ibb.co/fSxhDmP), she's touching Neteyam's back despite him being injured. In another [shot of Lo'ak looking up into the sky](https://ibb.co/YNbf85V) there's a head in the bottom right corner; the facial stripes and headband match Neytiri's but there's a set of hands rubbing her head. Those hands are small, feminine and five-fingered; consider they'd have to belong to someone with a close connection to Neytiri to deign such touch, then only Kiri qualifies.
In deaf/mute culture, on top of sign, people communicate through feels/touch: expressing themselves via tactile input in lieu of speaking. Only a family inured to feels/touch would not be unsettled by this strange behaviour, which to the deaf/mute is not strange at all but completely natural.

+ If she's a personification/extension of Eywa, well Eywa doesn't talk. Secondly the na'vi mantra is *To See*. The only way you can understand Kiri is if you *see her* just as the na'vi people see into Pandora. Being mute would showcase the symbolic meaning of this mantra on a tangible level.

+ Feels/touch would be normal to the Sully's but it'd be completely unsettling to anyone outside of the na'vi understanding. I'm referring to the recoms, specifically Quartich. Quaritch will be unnerved by Kiri just as Jake was by the woodsprites. (Jake even whacked one in a jerk reaction). Their shared marine training has/will fail to prepare them for something so harmless and so unassuming as a woodsprite; something that you don't realize until it's too late just how powerless you are to it's affect on you.
Direct quote from Stephen Lang regarding Quaritch in the upcoming movies.
> The world begins to – the world of Pandora – begins to affect him quite deeply in ways that he either refused or it did not affect him. And it gets under his skin.”

If Kiri represents Pandora, then she's going to get under his skin. She'll be the deadliest thing he ever encountered because this anthropomorphic woodsprite has the power to make him soft. And that'll bug the hell out of him.

**Personal Reasons**

+ Cameron's not afraid to write disabled heros. Jake Sully was a paraplegic. 

+ Now I'm going to insert myself and say that deaf/mute culture is a fascinating world that rewards anyone who goes out of their way to learn about it. For an inquisitive, empathetic soul like Cameron I don't see him being indifferent to the world of signing. Rather he'd showcase it in his work when given the chance. He sees beauty all around him and what better place to show it than this mangum opus that is his Avatar saga?",1660835172.0
Theory for possible climax of last film.,16,w3qt4l,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/w3qt4l/theory_for_possible_climax_of_last_film/,6,"I was wondering what would be the climax of the final movie (The quest for Eywa); it'd have to be something big, something that'd top everything prior; the highest stakes, all the marbles kind of thing. And above all, something that'd cause all sides to come together (mostly).

So what would that be? What would threaten everyone alike? Well, the destruction of Pandora; more specifically, her ecosystem. (Like a triggered volcanic eruption on a huge enough scale that could damage air quality to the point of choking out most life)The RDA's end goal is to mine it's minerals, it's fauna is an obstacle that's cost them billions but if Pandora were a dead world then the RDA can mine in peace since the humans already can and do survive independently of the world. I'm thinking that the real big bad of this story has promoted a way to blot out life on Pandora, someone who doesn't care who is sacrificed to obtain their end goal and that's not even the survival of Earth but pure self interest.

Which comes to my second theory, the big bad will be Selfridge. In this story you can't be a fence sitter, you're either for helping Pandora or letting her burn. That last look Selfridge gave Jake screamed 'It's not over yet.' The actor is slated for all four movies and I don't think he's coming back a tree hugger. That this not entirely evil, almost empathetic corporate shirt—in his wounded pride and chagrin—will embody the irredeemable, psychopathic selfishness of big business. Remember, like Selfridge, the RDA didn't start out with malicious intent but that's changed and so will he. It would be an ironic twist that the first movies villains would reverse roles and Selfridge would become a heartless force that'd unnerve even Quaritch.

And this comes to my third theory, what would be the solution? I've a feeling it's Kiri, I've suggested it before that's she's an embodiment of Eywa, an anthropomorphic woodsprite(seed of the great tree). But this would mean Eywa has gone quiet in the world to the unease of the na'vi. If Eywa is in her, she's destined to come out again. Through Kiri, Eywa will defeat this threat but it'll will require everyone to lay down arms and come together to make it happen.

This would mirror the first movie in some respects but instead of all the clans, it'll be all the forces.

"Eywa is a world-conquering, ecosystem-shaping, tool-using superintelligence and its tools are the lifeforms it has bred over who knows how long. It absorbs their memories and controls their behavior to serve its purposes.",116,13iryon,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/13iryon/eywa_is_a_worldconquering_ecosystemshaping/,32,"The ecology of Pandora has several bizarre features that don't make sense if you assume normal evolution by natural selection. There are a couple that really stick out though:

1. The USB braids on most large animals that act as a neural interface.

* This is an extremely complex adaptation anatomically and so it must serve an extremely important purpose to be conserved or deleterious mutations would accumulate. Normally only things necessary for survival or reproduction fit and this doesn't qualify as *necessary.*
* As a method of communication it is extremely inefficient for the vast majority of survival or social purposes compared to bioluminescence, physical displays, and noise which almost every animal has. There's little evidence most animals even use it for communication within their species.
* Even assuming it is for communication, why would it function in predators, prey, even *trees?* that takes more than a connection, it takes compatibility or a system that can force compatibility.

&#x200B;

2.  Eywa's special trees (particularly the Tree of Souls, the Tree of Voices and the underwater Metakayina Spirit Tree)

* These trees have an extremely specialized function that makes it very good at tasks that have nothing to do with any sane survival strategy. You could argue that their ability is sort of the equivalent of a tree making fruit to tempt Navi into protecting them, but why not just get them high or something like a sane plant? That would be a billion times simpler than storing the memories of their ancestors and allowing them to commune with a global tree-consciousness.
* The storage and computation capacity this implies is absurd.
* In the end of the first movie the tree literally grew vines into Grace and Jake and transferred their consciousness between bodies - seemingly in response to Na'vi chants and dance.

That last point is especially telling. If this tree can invade a human brain and transfer its mind into another organism, what else can it do to local wildlife?

We already know it's memory capacity and processing power are great enough to store human minds and emulate them in-tree-situ (Grace visions in Avatar2) - they also apparently contain generations of Navi's memories.

All this leads us to the most plausible explanation for the ecology of Pandora:

Eywa put natural selection in the back seat long ago, it has methods of controlling the evolution of not only itself (to create the different specialized trees) but other life forms of the planet to suit its purposes.

The USB braids exist to improve its control. The Special Trees exist to improve its awareness. Life on Pandora? It is an extension of Eywa.

How?

There's only a few ways this could have happened:

1. Eywa killed everything that didn't conform to its long term plans.
2. Eywa selectively rewarded life that conformed to its long term plans. Perhaps by controlling food availability.
3. Eywa modifies the instincts and social behaviors of life to guide sexual selection to favor creatures that conform to its long term plans.This would take more time but fits the evidence better.
4. Alien intervention.

Evidence for the third possibility is the Tulkun/whales suddenly reshaping their instinctual behaviors:

>In the time of the First Songs, tulkun were aggressive, violent, vindictive, and highly territorial. They often killed each other, but at some point they discovered that this attitude led to further escalation of aggression and over time, they developed a strong pacifism and a sense of morality that forbade them from killing other living creatures. From now on, any tulkun who commits such an act, regardless of the circumstances, becomes an outcast of his own kind.

This could easily be a culture scale intervention by Eywa and the poorly developed brain USB indicates that Eywa's work on them was slow going - possibly from their lack of predators and slow reproduction.

Seems kinda sinister IMO. Keep in mind here that Eywa's vines can operate on a literal alien's consciousness and in minutes transfer it to the artificial product of alien biotechnology on its *first* *encounter* with a human brain. Reprogramming an animal's mind should be well within its capabilities.

In short: Eywa is a world conquering ecosystem shaping tool-using superintelligence and its tools are the lifeforms it has created. It absorbs their memories and controls their behavior and when prompted by the right song/dance can probe alien brains and suck out their consciousness like its nothing.

The required effort and action to create Pandora as it is suggests Eywa is definitely not *just* some benevolent tree-mind.",1684202964.0

* Lo'ak says to Neteyam about rescuing Spider ""He's our brother from another mother""

* Neytiri giving Spider a disapproving look when he wants to join the funeral for Neteyam

* There was an extra scene of Neteyam following Lo'ak around. Neteyam says, ""You think I like babysitting you? I'm just trying to keep your dumb a** out of trouble!"" Tsireya then appears and tells Neteyam she will watch out for Lo'ak.


* Ronal tries to frame Kiri's seizure as evidence Eywa has turned her back on the Sully family. This may have been removed because it can easily be seen as a low blow towards a family with one of its members in a coma, and making Ronal to unlikable would make viewers sympathize with her less when Ro'a is killed.


* Lo'ak wanted Tsireya to teach him sign language, specifically the phrase ""We are from different worlds, but we have a connection"" this makes her blush and become flustered during this exchange.




* Aonung apologizes to Kiri for his behavior while they are hiding in an airbell from the RDA, causing her to point out the awkward timing.



* Aonung name was originally, ""Nu'ung""




* In the original script, Rotxo calls Aonung ""cuz"", raising the possibility they are cousins in the final film.



* It is Kiri and Spider who receive a hug from Jake at the end, with Tuk joining them. However, Lo'ak stands apart, unable to face his parents. Tsireya sees his anguish and reaches for him, but he pulls away ashamed. There was also originally no scene earlier where Jake says ""I see you"" to Lo'ak"" nor does Jake bother to thank Lo'ak for saving him in the SeaDragon. This was likely changed in the final version to give Lo'ak more sense of peace.

Just a Tsireya appreciation,66,11ssr1t,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/11ssr1t/just_a_tsireya_appreciation/,20,"Just wanted to make an appreciation, so thank you in advance if you're reading this. :D

If you think about it, Tsireya is the first Na'vi who is not afraid of foreigners and has no prejudices.
In the first movie, when Jake met the Omatikaya clan, everyone was suspicious and they knew that he wasn't a true Na'vi, so they didn't trust him, especially Tsu'tey. Even Neytiri wanted to kill him, but she stopped because the atokirina approached him and she understood that Eywa wanted him to be there.
In the second movie, when the Sullys met the Metkayina clan, Ronal exposed their ""demon blood"" and the whole clan looked down on them, also because they were from the forest and they were very different. Only Tonowari showed some kind of respect because he was the leader and he had to maintain a certain behavior.
Instead, Tsireya was never afraid of them and she even smiled at Lo'ak from the start. She never cared about the Sullys being from the forest and she didn't see Jake and his kids as aliens. She was curious and excited to teach them the traditions and the customs of her clan, and she never made fun of them when they made mistakes, like her brothers did.
My favorite scene ever of Tsireya and Lo'ak is the one where she says:""I see you."" It's just so beautiful.
Lo'ak had been disrespected, made fun of, seen as an alien, and he also bonded with Payakan, which was believed to be a killer by the whole clan.
Yet, Tsireya was never disappointed or afraid, but genuinely proud of him and worried about his safety.
She held his hand, the same alien hand that he was ashamed of, and said the most important words that a Na'vi could ever say to anyone. 

She is one of my favorite characters and I can't wait to see her (and Lo'ak) in the sequels.",1678969751.0

Quaritch Sucks: An Essay,40,y7fmq2,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/y7fmq2/quaritch_sucks_an_essay/,62,"&#x200B;

Colonel Miles Quaritch is a fearsome warrior without peer.

He's also a fucking terrible military commander, and humanity's exile from Pandora is almost entirely because of the stupid decisions he makes prior to and during the Battle of the Tree of Souls.

After attacking the Omaticaya's ancestral Hometree, Jake Sully manages to tame a Great Leonopteryx, thereby becoming Toruk Makto. He immediately begins rallying the clans to his banner, presumably to mass enough warriors to overrun Hell's Gate.

Quaritch sees this rapid build-up of forces happening on satellite imagery. He realizes two things:

1.) Time is not on his side

2.) Firepower is

Due to Sully's earlier reports, Quaritch knows that the Na'vi army is massing around the Tree of Souls, an incredibly sacred location among the indigenous. To this end, he concocts a plan: a low-altitude bombing run upon the Tree of Souls, using pallets of mining explosives as jury-rigged daisy cutters. As time is of the essence, he organizes this attack to happen in less than 24 hours.

Sully is informed of this plan, and makes the decision to let the enemy force come to him as to neutralize the advantage of the enemy's advanced target tracking systems, which would be ineffective within the heart of the flux vortex.

Quaritch, by destroying the Tree of Souls, means to scatter the enemy horde around the sacred site and shatter Na'vi morale so thoroughly that in his words, ""they won't come within a thousand clicks of this place ever again"". On the morning of the operation, he commits most if not all significant airborne and ground-based assets to escort the Valkyrie to its target.

Jake Sully, leading the ad-hoc assembly of clans, aims to attack the SecOps force within the Hallelujah Mountains, close to the Tree of Souls, where the flux vortex is strongest and where any attack will achieve the greatest surprise. As Quaritch's forces leave Hell's Gate, Sully leads his own entire assembled army into battle to ready their ambush.

This is a classic battle of annihilation. Loser ceases to exist as a coherent fighting force.

Quaritch loses. And it's all his fault.

Quaritch seemingly attacks the Tree of Souls with the ENTIRE COMBINED FORCE of Hell's Gate. Didn't even keep any forces in reserve in case shit went south. As far as we can tell, he leaves behind barely anything to actually guard the base. He puts literally all of the RDA's chips down on a single operation, leaving behind nothing to oppose the enemy force should the operation fail. Which is exactly what happens, and the Na'vi take over Hell's Gate apparently without a fight.

Sure, he had no reason to think any other force could attack the base during battle. He had every reason to believe he'd win the battle. Doesn't matter. He committed his entire force and left either nothing or nearly nothing to guard his main base. The gods of war do not smile upon overconfidence.

Quaritch attacks with almost zero intel. All he really has is the satellite images, and all those tell him is very roughly how big the enemy force is and its approximate location. He doesn't send forward scouts, he doesn't make probing attacks, he doesn't even set up a vanguard force of any kind. He just rolls his entire army into the Hallelujah Mountains in one giant doomstack, guaranteeing unnecessary casualties even with victory. He even apparently is aware he's walking into an ambush and tells his men right before the fighting to keep their heads on a swivel. He KNEW the enemy force would likely attempt an ambush, and still made no real attempts to mitigate it. Men have been court-martialed for less.

He commits to fighting the battle on the terms of the Na'vi. He doesn't pull back to force an engagement in open skies and away from the flux vortex where he'd have a greater advantage, and he doesn't try to clear the distance between him and his foe. He presses the target, no matter what, no matter the casualties, in an all-or-nothing gamble. This is not behavior that wins wars.

&#x200B;

**BUH BUH HE WOULD'VE WON IF EYWA DIDN'T**

&#x200B;

This is what every Quaritch simp will bring up: that if the wildlife hadn't attacked him en masse, he would've totally blown up the Tree of Souls. I'm not sure this is even true; Pandora's fauna didn't stop the bombing run, Sully did, what they did was clear the skies of escorts and provide a distraction. Made things easier for Jake for sure, but it was ultimately two grenades and some duct tape that brought the Valkyrie down. But for the sake of argument, let's say he would have.

To that, I say this: Cry more. War isn't fair.

Shit happens you don't expect. A good commander creates contingencies and anticipates, even assumes, worst case scenarios. But Quaritch assumed only glorious victory. He committed his ENTIRE FORCE to the battle. He left NOTHING to guard the base, and waltzed right into the enemy ambush. By his own actions, he guaranteed failure at the Tree of Souls would not just be a defeat but a total rout. And even if he did win, it'd be with casualties he very well would have avoided if he didn't just throw his entire army at the enemy all at once in one giant swarm. And it's not like this was the Borg appearing out of nowhere, he should've known better than anyone that Pandoran fauna is vicious and territorial.

Every fuckup Quaritch makes comes back to his ego, his overwhelming hatred of Pandora that clouds his judgment, his personal thirst for glory, and his temper.

Flaws.

Colonel Quaritch is charismatic.

Colonel Quaritch is fearless.

Colonel Quaritch is badass.

Colonel Quaritch is also a hotheaded, obsessive glory hound and it gets him and his men killed.

What you have to understand about Quaritch is that he's not really a military commander. He literally isn't. He's a security chief. A colonial rent-a-cop, given just enough men and material to defend the company's outpost and mining equipment. And nothing else. Yet he acts like he's Patton, some brilliant strategist that will be remembered in the history books for all time when his biggest military accomplishments we see are 1.) chopping down a tree and 2.) losing the only battle he ever commands. There's a profound hubris in everything he does. He's absolutely the single most dangerous human on Pandora, but being a good warrior doesn't mean being a good leader of armed forces. In fact, it's often a detriment.

Miles is a man of singular drive. An indomitable will and focus. It's his greatest strength. It's also his greatest weakness, because the same traits that make him so determined and badass also make him prone to a quality that ends up being his downfall. All his flaws are bad, but there's one that's fatal. It's what costs him his life and what costs the RDA Pandora.

Quaritch gets tunnel vision. And he gets it BAD.

When Quaritch sets his mind to something, he will see it through, no matter what. This would be admirable if it weren't for the fact that Quartich is also prone to anger. He has a choleric temperament, easily irritated. And when he gets angry, his determination makes him focus on the source of that anger to the exclusion of everything else. Combine that with his drive for glory, and he just plain forgets the world around him even exists.

This is the fourth, final, and greatest blunder he makes: over and over, he allows himself to get mad, get tunnel vision, and eventually get dead.

During the battle, it happens FIVE SEPARATE TIMES.

&#x200B;

TUNNEL VISION #1:

He spots Jake on the Leonopteryx, immediately drops everything he's doing and embarks on a wild-ass goose chase through the floating mountains to kill him instead of, you know, guarding the Valkyrie like he's supposed to be doing. You could argue it was tactical sense to try and kill the enemy commander, but his focusing on Jake makes him unaware of any other potential threats and leads directly to:

&#x200B;

TUNNEL VISION #2:

He's attacked by Rogue One, piloted by Trudy. She manages to riddle his Dragon's back with holes and even almost hits him by firing directly into the Dragon's canopy. He immediately forgets about Jake and concentrates on Trudy. Okay, sure, at that moment she's a legitimate threat, makes sense to switch focus to her.

Until he shoots out her engines and sends her Samson into a slow death spiral. Rogue One is effectively neutralized and out of the fight. At this point he could break off, return to the main battle or try to chase down Sully and let Rogue One crash at his leisure, but he ain't having that. He keeps chasing her, keeps wasting time, keeps hounding an enemy that's no longer a threat just so he can have the satisfaction of blowing them to smithereens. And by the time he DOES blow Rogue One up, Jake Sully has long since gotten away and is now in position to make his run at the Valkyrie.

When the wildlife attacks, they're able to overrun the Scorpions and Samsons, but not the heavier craft like the Valkyrie and the Dragon, which also means if Quaritch had simply kept his cool and not abandoned the shuttle, even WITH Eywa's help Jake wouldn't have been able to get near the Valkyrie without getting shot down. But since Quaritch got tunnel vision, he's completely forgotten about Sully, who is now free to give the Valkyrie's crew a lesson in lithobraking.

Right now, Quaritch has lost the battle, and therefore Pandora. The next few instances are what lose him his life.

&#x200B;

TUNNEL VISION #3:

After Quaritch's Dragon gets blowed up, he marches off into the woods and finds Jake's link shack. Instead of just lighting it up, he savors the moment JUST long enough for Neytiri to pounce him from behind with the thanator. He only notices her at the very last moment, and is forced to wrassle the thanator. Though he's ultimately victorious, the time he's spent fighting Neytiri has given Jake Sully time to catch up, which results in:

&#x200B;

TUNNEL VISION #4

This is the big one. Quaritch has killed the thanator. Neytiri is trapped underneath it, very obviously struggling to free herself and showing every sign she's still hostile. He gets ready to stab her.

&#x200B;

Then Jake shows up. Quaritch turns around, sees the guy that blew up his command ship, redirects ALL his focus and anger on Jake, and just like that completely forgets Neytiri's still there, still very much intending to kill him. While he's fighting Jake, Neytiri is spending every second pulling more of herself out from under the dead thanator, safe from any intervention by Quaritch because she poofed from his mind the instant Jake appeared. She might as well be invisible at this point.

&#x200B;

TUNNEL VISION #5

Quaritch gets the idea to punch through the link shack's window and smash the link units. There's only two of them, and even if he picks the wrong one first, it'll still flood the link shack with toxic atmosphere and kill Jake anyway. Actually sound tactical decision!

He punches through the window, smashes the first link unit. Empty. Darn.

And then he just walks over to the other window like he's looking for his fucking car keys, Jake being right behind him a distant memory at this point. When Jake jumps on his AMP Suit to stop him, Quaritch reacts with GENUINE SURPRISE and very nearly gets stabbed in the face for it.

Lucky for him, the toxic atmosphere starts to take effect and Sully starts struggling even to stand up. He's no longer a threat. But Quaritch needs his satisfaction. Instead of using the opportunity to smash the link chamber or even just splatter Jake's avatar, he picks him up and holds the dagger to Jake's throat. Furious. The tunnel in Quaritch's head is dark and narrow and at the end of it is a vision of him cutting Sully open like a Christmas goose. He has to reach it. He must.

&#x200B;

Having totally forgotten about Neytiri, who has taken advantage of all the time he's wasted to free herself, get her bow, and plug a pair of arrows into his chest. The last expression we see him make is shock. Not shock from pain, but from these two giant pieces of wood that have just magically materialized into his chest cavity somehow.

Quaritch is a bad commander, because he'll throw away your life and the life of your buddies so he can bum-rush a target pretending he's Alexander the Great. He'll abandon formations to chase personal vendettas, and he'll waste valuable time to satisfy his bloodlust.

And even if you ignore his incompetence as an officer, Quaritch is STILL a fucking loser even as a soldier. Brave and badass as he is, he's also vicious and short-tempered, and that shit ALWAYS ends up being a liability. A danger everyone around him, ESPECIALLY himself, and if you want proof, just take a gander at those scars on his head. Hell's Gate is a literal fortress surrounded by walls, automated sentries and barbed wire; how the fuck did he manage to get himself mauled on his *first fucking day?* There's no way you can convince me he didn't hop the perimeter to chase down a critter because it looked at him funny or something.

Men like Quaritch are to be kept as far away from any serious military command as possible and failing that, fragged.",1666119621.0
Lo'ak has more human traits than any of his siblings,40,112y7rg,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/112y7rg/loak_has_more_human_traits_than_any_of_his/,13,"It seems to me that Lo'ak has more human traits than anyone else besides Jake. The way he thinks... his character is too much like the way humans behave. Maybe he wants to be like a father, or is it inherent in his character, but did you notice how he constantly wanted to use weapons, was the best friend with Spider, despite the fact that he is a human? It seems to me that despite the fact that he grew up among Na'vi, he is more like Jake in his behavior. Even if we take into account that he considered himself an outcast, he still liked who he was, resemblance to both Na'vi and human.

Do you think the Na'vi have ever experienced famine?,38,1ahketm,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/1ahketm/do_you_think_the_navi_have_ever_experienced_famine/,22,"Throughout human history, the quest for food was possibly the most critical endeavor of any community, be it settled agricultural tribes, wandering nomads or anywhere in between.
Decisions regarding food supply were not taken lightly, nor were their supplies taken for granted, because famines are possibly the greatest and most terrible destroyers of human community, forcing its victims to abandon mouths they can not feed or fight over what to do next, in some cases resorting to cannibalism.

The world they lived in was also largely unknown and unpredictable, so the structuring of specific migration paths, primitive land cultivation and stockpiling were their best bet to stave off the possibility of famine, creating entire traditions and cultures around them, but even so, harvests can fail, herds for game can disappear and stockpiles can be pillaged or spoiled.

On top of all of this, Earth's climate has always been in flux and is probably the greatest deciding factor in the availability of food in any ecosystem, something all living things on Earth are subject to.

Now relating this back to the Na'vi, more specifically their connection to Eywa whom appears to pursue a perfectly stable and symbiotic biosphere across Pandora.
We _know_ that Eywa is capable of influencing the behaviors of its fauna and flora, and we also see the Na'vi do very little in the way of hoarding or stockpiling food for lean times, implying that there is perhaps no need to do so, which would make sense given the natural abundance of their habitat.

I am wondering to what extent Eywa's influences can and does mitigate the risk of famine in Na'vi societies, as well as other calamities such as plague, and ponder just how alien such a life may be to human cultures that do live with the anxiety of material scarcity.",1706924525.0

While it's understandable given Lo'ak's behavior, I always thought there was a little something extra there, which lead me to consider how we often can become particularly annoyed when we see things we don't like about ourselves in other people...then I started to put together just how many similarities and parallels there are between Jake and Lo'ak.

* Impulsively gets into a fistfight defending someone being bullied/harassed - Check
* Narrowly escapes being hunted by a top predator - Check
* Develops a relationship with the Chief's daughter - Check
* Bonds with the toughest animal around - Check
* Doesn't hesitate to defy his superiors to do what he believes is right (warn Payakan) - Check

As I've watched more, I think a big part of the film is really building up to the moment when Lo'ak teaches his father about breathing and saves him, which helps bring about a sea change in Jake's view of his ""problem"" son that I think will be expanded on in Avatar 3.

"Aonung, (expressing some thoughts)",26,1149l5g,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/1149l5g/aonung_expressing_some_thoughts/,8,"Ok so um…Aonung. He confuses me, like a lot. Let’s start from the beginning he presents himself as bold, cocky and a bit of an ass. Typical teenager stuff, when it was him and Rotxo at the beginning when the Sully’s first arrived, he isn’t scared of them or particularly disgusted, mostly curious. Rotxo is the one that actually starts making fun of their tails and Aonung laughs in the background and points a little until Tsireya interrupts them. Like I said, a bit of an asshole but nothing too unexpected considering who his mother is and the fact that he’s a bitchy teenager. A bitchy teenager pissed because they got stuck doing something they didn’t wanna do.


Then his band of tyrants come along. Looking like actual fish on land….not a good way. And then his attitude kinda switches, he’s not just bitchy anymore now he’s downright bullying these kids and he’s getting physical with it. And his peers look to him for approval of their horrendous behavior and expect him to lead them, as the olo’eytkans only son. Which he does because he kinda sucks. But as soon as Neteyam comes around he relaxes and backs down, which the other kids don’t appreciate (probably thought he was being weak). Fight breaks out, he tries to get his dignity backs and humiliate Lo’ak by leaving him beyond the reef. A petty revenge gone horribly wrong, and I think he realizes that because HE told Neteyam what happened, by himself. No one told him to do it, I think that says something about him as a person, idk what though. Lo’ak lies for him and Aonung starts to see him, and respects him.


The thing that bothers me is how docile he is around his parents. Example, when the kids got lectured bc Lo’ak bonded with Payakan, even Tsireya kinda stands her ground. She doesn’t say anything but she isn’t exactly hiding that she’s on Lo’ak’s side either. Also Ronal immediately scolds her and doesn’t even look a Aonung even though he’s older and was there the whole time? I don’t think it was because of any privilege either. It’s like they don’t expect anything from him at all(good or bad) which is rly weird. And during that scene Aonung is just kinda there? He looks a little sad when Tonowari scolds Tsireya and doesn’t even bother getting a word in. Which is weird since he was so bold voicing his opinion about the Sully’s. I get, kids act different around their parents, but he looked like he’d keel over if his parents commanded him to whenever they’re around 

To add to that, he’s not even destined for anything. Tsireya will be Tsahik. So he’s not some future clans leader or anything, no responsibilities. So if he’s got no expectations, why does he shut down like that around his parents? He’s a bold, confident, kinda funny, and an assholish teenager who loves his sister. But he looks like the type of person that would never initiate first contact, not cuz he’s shy but because he’s just not a people person. When he does speak though he a mouthy kid, attitude, jokes and all. According to the Visual Dictionary he’s a fisher, who likes to body surf, likes collecting pretty things to make jewelry, adds triplets to his songcord other cute stuff like that.

I also don’t really get why he was such a bitch to the kids. Like ik he’s an a hole, but like…there’s gotta be more. There’s his mother and everyone else in the clan who doesn’t like forest people, the tyrant band, and personal pettiness probably caused that. Like was he looking for the approval of his peers?

I just think his relationship with his parents is odd. Tsireya is probably the golden child.

So idk, this was rant sorry ;-;",1676604854.0
Things to watch out for when writing about the Na'vi? Common phrases or behavior? Things they typically would or wouldn't do?

Mainly about the Sarentu. 

But I'm VERY new to the world building & lore of Avatar. I've watched the movies before, but just as a casual fan. FOP is what got me truly invested.

I make this post because I'm worried my lack of knowledge will make any fics I write painful to read lol. So are there any common mistakes writers/fans make when it comes to Na'vi culture? What are some things where you read a fic (or a post, or etc.), and immediately go *""oof, that character / the Na'vi would not do that""* or *""that \[item or activity\] isn't even a thing on Pandora"",* or things of that nature?

An example would be something like this: when trying to come up with names for the Sarentu playable character, I learned that the apostrophe in Na'vi names only come after vowels. So I'm now mindful to not make a Na'vi OC have a name where an apostrophe comes after a consonant, because it wouldn't fit established lore.

Are there any other tips or advice you have when it comes to writing about the Na'vi? It could be about characterization, world building, lore, anything! All of it will be appreciated!",1704654583.0
Let’s talk abt Spider(Avatr WOW),24,108kpts,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/108kpts/lets_talk_abt_spideravatr_wow/,19,"Sooo….y’all hate spider?? Let’s I want to understand this whole think, like Jake said, “what’s the thinkin?” because I can’t tell if y’all hate him for kicks or y’all really do t like him. Because I think that it doesn’t really make sense to hate him, ESPECIALLY if y’all love Neytiri after HER scene.

I’ve seen some people say “how could he save him after everything Quaritch did” “he betrayed the Sully’s after growing up with them” or “should’ve been him and not Neteyam” let’s be serious. Neytiri almost gutted him like a fish after watching him grow up as well, Spider literally did nothing to her, he just existed💀 by the logic that he’s human, then she should’ve hated Grace too, and Jake, especially Jake. 

Don’t get me wrong I understand her behavior, it’s still hypocritical to hate him tho. The fact is she probably would’ve hated him less simply if he had an avatar is SAD.

Also , think about it.

The woman who watched you grow up since you were 4 yo, saw how much her kids loved you and knows good and well you have the education of every other Na’vi child, used you as a bargaining chip, slashed your chest and then tried murder you. And the only adult who had enough sense to care abt you is the father who knew you for a couple of months vs 14 years??? Me personally….I’d save the one who saved me🤷🏿‍♀️

Also the betrayal comments are weird because the Sully’s also betrayed and abandoned him to get tortured for months about THEIR whereabouts and the kids were the only ones who he cared tbh. Jake cared but to him he just didn’t have enough room in his heart to take care of their personal stray cat ig. And Neytiri just straight didn’t gaf😭

HOWEVER!!! I do think it was a very very VERY dumb choice to make, probably because I wouldn’t be righteous to save Quaritch. Quaritch is still a genocidal maniac and I hope he gets murdered every time he tries to come back for the Na’Vi. Neteyam should’ve at least gotten his last wish granted. Neytiri has lost too much in her life and I hope she gets peace with Eywa and her loved ones whoever she dies. Lo’ak really needs to get it together and Jake has to be more aware of his affect on his son. Tuk is too young for this.

I like Spider as a character but,17,110e0bo,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/110e0bo/i_like_spider_as_a_character_but/,12,"I find it hard to believe that the Quaritch we saw in the first movie would have a son.

I wish they would have shown Quaritch with his son/partner in the first movie to show that maybe he does have some amount of tenderness in him. To me, the Quaritch we saw in A1 seemed like he had no room in his heart for anything but war. Like he barely even cared about the RDA’s mission, it seemed like he just wanted to play psychopath soldier.

He was so so so very willing to die in combat, like he clearly WANTED to die in combat, and that just doesn’t seem like the behavior of a man with a child. Sure, maybe he was just a completely absent father but if that was the case why would he feel any duty toward’s Spider? Or is he really just a complete psychopath who’s just 100% using Spider and feels no connection to him whatsoever? Doubt it but  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Plus, Quaritch and Spider’s mother obviously had enough of a relationship to name him after his father.

Even though I like the dynamic of Spider’s struggle with his chosen family and his “biological” family, it feels pretty retconned that Quaritch had a son during the whole first movie.

That being said, I’m excited to see how Quaritch’s character develops and if ol’ Jimmy decides to give him a full on Darth Vader moment.",1676202764.0

Possible theory for avatar 3,14,12x4z41,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/12x4z41/possible_theory_for_avatar_3/,4,"**Contains leaked spoilers**





So been reading posts about neytiri and spider's relationship in avatar 3 and how neytiri is going to change. Considering she is going through it mentally and her character is really being pushed; i just had a thought, what if based on the leaked script when spider can breath pandora's air

What if because of plot, spider's mask is forcibly removed or broken or something and instead of helping him, neytiri leaves.

So the story goes: third movie plot stuff happens and spider is captured/close to death/mask is forcibly remoced. Like human jake suffocating towards the end of the 1st film before hes saved by neytiri or quaritch almost drowning at the end of atwow and only surviving because spider saved him. But instead of choosing to save the other, she chooses to leave. Why would she do this?

Why would she be so angry with him this time around? Maybe quaritch fucks more shit up in the third movie, then its revealed spider saved him in the atwow and she just breaks; After everything thats happened, after jake accepted him as his son. Spider never mentioned saving quaritch so she feels he lied the entire time. Any trust built throughout the third film is crushed, and to save him kiri heals him and he is able to breath. 

What do yee think? It does seem like a bit stretch, but james says that neytiri is going to be challenged more in avatar 3. And we saw this character grief stricken and acting out of character; using her father's bow not for its intended use to shoot arrows but as an actual weapon for breaking necks on a rampage. She looked lost when she realised she broke her father's bow, i think her behavior hit her amd she realised how deep her rage went. 

Would be an interesting call back to the first movie when she saved jake as mentioned above, but instead doesn't help spider put on his oxygen masks and just leaves him to die. Alternatively I thought about Neytiri being the one to remove Spider's against his will but even I thought that would be a bit too much.",1682315187.0
A Guide to Watching Avatar (2009) from a Hollywood Writer's POV,12,zn7gwq,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zn7gwq/a_guide_to_watching_avatar_2009_from_a_hollywood/,11,"I’ve been a professional screenwriter since 2016. I’ve written short films for Paul Rudd, Keanu Reeves (see Anyone Can Quantum on yt), and even Zoe Saldana (Quantum is Calling on yt). With Avatar 2 looming I thought I could re-examine the oft-maligned story with fresh eyes, using all the tools I have picked up – the same tools I use to craft my own stories. In particular I was looking to see how closely the film sticks to the tried and true Hollywood writing principles. Hopefully this breakdown & guide will help you pick up on some things you may not have picked up on in previous watches.

THIS GUIDE IS A BEAST TO GET THROUGH. **So here’s a TLDR for you:**

Using a sequence by sequence analysis, and looking for the typical Hero’s Journey landmarks, we can roughly identify the series of themes that James Cameron was at some level attempting to address, question, or argue, with this film. What I found was a remarkably consistent and well-thought out structure designed to show the physical and then spiritual maturation of our own avatar (Jake Sully). The film is clearly & unabashedly about Jake transforming into another being by the end, one who has transcended at some level. Here are the themes for sequences, and how they contribute to the overall theme of transcendence.

Sequence :: Time Stamps :: Theme :: Maturation Stage

1 :: 0:00-12:00 (+2) :: Man in the Box (Womb) :: Infant 

2 :: 14:00-24:00 :: You’re Real Legs :: Toddler

3 :: 24:00-36:00 :: Strong Heart, but … Ignorant Like a Child :: Child

4 :: 36:00-49:00 :: Eywa’s Seed :: Puberty

5 :: 49:00-1:00:00 :: The Bond (Sex Ed) :: Time for “the talk”

6 :: 1:00:00-1:13:00 :: Do or Die (Driver’s License Exam) :: Teenager, dating

7 :: 1:13:00-1:21:30 :: ~~The Prom &~~ Graduation :: Adulthood

8 :: 1:21:30-1:34:20 :: Neural Networks & Memory :: Recognize the Divine

9 :: 1:34:20-1:48:15 :: Attack on Hometree :: Owning one’s Mistakes

10 :: 1:48:15-2:02:00 :: Saving Grace :: Witnesses Absorption into the Divine Light

11 :: 2:02:00-2:14:23 :: Gathering the Armies :: Commune with Divine

12 :: 2:14:23-2:35:00:: To the Death :: Willing to be Absorbed into the Divine

The first half of the movie is about a man who is reborn and challenged enough to physically, mentally and emotionally mature to adulthood. Then after reaching the baseline of adulthood Jake is tapped into a process of spiritual maturity. This culminates in a life-risking trust-fall into the consciousness of Eywa. 

**END OF TLDR;**

THE APPROACH: Quickly, (1) modern movies are made up of 12 sequences, each meant to be around the same length, like the 12 hours on a clock. There can be more or less, of course, but there’s a lot of specific business each of these needs to fulfill, so it’s best not to mess too much around with this format. (2) Each sequence is a kind of short story of its own, with a beginning, middle and end. More importantly, for someone like me, they contain a 1st act, 2nd act break, midpoint, low point, and battle or resolution – it’s never quite a complete story of course, otherwise the rest of the sequences wouldn’t be necessary. (3) Each sequence typically sets up the stakes and circumstances for the next sequence. As a whole, the sequences should create a row of 12 dominoes. One push of the finger at the first domino should create a chain reaction, pushing the audience to the end. Of course, one misplaced domino can kill the momentum – or, for an audience, kill the immersion. 

In the end a movie basically needs to be a 2 hour long distraction. Or in the case of Avatar, a 2.5 hour long distraction. A 150 minute long movie should have 12-13 minute long sequences, so that’ll be the standard length I’ll use to determine sequences. So let’s jump right in and look at the very first 12 minutes of Avatar…

**Sequence 1 (00:00-12:00) “Man in the Box”**

THEME: Because each sequence is like a little short story, that means that they each have their own theme – some central premise or moral that the writer debates using points and counterpoints delivered by a cast of characters and their actions. We open on Jake Sully, emerging from a cryosleep unit. But visually, it looks like Jake is being pulled out from a mortuary cabinet in a morgue. But whereas traditionally in film the bodies come out feet first – so a mortician can identify the body by their toe tag – Jake emerges here head-first, as if emerging from a womb. So immediately we’re being told that death and rebirth are a major focus of this sequence.

‘Man in the Box’ refers not only to the literal state at which we first encounter Jake, but there’s also a metaphorical double-meaning. When his dropship lands within the complex of the mining company – and when we first learn that Jake is wheelchair bound – he is immediately met with pity and dismissed by mercenaries. And although Norm and Max are cordial with him, we get the impression from the whole team that Jake is considered a liability. He is metaphorically ‘boxed in’ by everyone he meets. 

And we also get the impression that there must have been more than just money that motivated Jake to end up on Pandora. The one-way trip alone took 6 years. And the quick mention of how his brother, Tommy, died tries to suggest that Earth has become a desperate and dangerous place to live. So presumably Jake had nothing to live for on Earth. This opportunity, to step into a job custom made for his twin brother, is a chance to start life over, as a new person. Reborn.

TIMING: At about 3 minutes the dropship enters Pandora atmosphere (roughly 25% in). At the midpoint, or 6 minutes) Jake drops in on a safety briefing delivered by the antagonist, Col. Quaritch. Then at 9 minutes, or 75% in, Jake is introduced to his avatar. (The 75% mark is typically reserved for the low point – but we don’t necessarily need one of those early in the movie.) The avatars have just been transferred over from the dropship where they had been maturing over the last 6 years in a bath like amniotic fluid. The avatar even has an umbilical cord and punches and kicks with involuntary muscle movement just like a fetus.

Grace, the head of the science team & Avatar program, is then introduced, also emerging from a box, this one a link unit. The unit looks just like any other sci-fi cryo sleep chamber, but with the additional aesthetics of a coffin.

SETUPS: Each sequence tends to bring up concepts, plot threads, and Chekov’s guns that won’t bear out until later in the story. This sequence introduces 12 such ‘setups’ by my count:

Sequence 1

1. Toxic atmosphere. 
Yes (barely).

2. Jake’s paraplegia. 
Yes.

3. Giant arrows.
Yes.

4. “Not in Kansas anymore” (Oz).
No.

5. Quaritch’s scar. 
Yes.

6. Video logs.
Yes.

7. Grace emerges from a link unit.
Yes. 

8. Drivers are vulnerable in a link unit, like a womb.
Yes.

9. Grace smokes. 
No.

10. “Try to use big words”.
No.

11. Selfridge & golf.
No. 

12. Unobtainum’s properties.
Yes (barely).

There are two more setups: (13) the introductory shot of Jake is on his eyes opening & (14) in Jake’s opening narration, as the camera whisks over a rainforest, he mentions flying and feeling free in his dreams. As for the former, the opening shot is commonly matched to the very last shot of the film, so this payoff is intrinsically expected. And as for the latter, this narrated foreshadowing is part of a word salad that didn’t even register to me on my first watches. I believe that it has to do with the general nature of narration, i.e. if you don’t show me that desire – to fly – through Jake’s behavior, then it falls flat. As a writer I tend to treat a character’s literal spoken words as superficial. Commonly, dialogue buries deeper truths of a character. The outspoken wants of a character are usually lies meant to deflect or distract. No one wants to be transparent, vulnerable. It takes time to get to the truth. But we usually get a peek under the surface by their choices, their actions.

JOURNEY STAGES: Each sequence is generally associated with a stage of the Hero’s Journey. The first sequence not only establishes the ordinary world, but it also delivers the theme statement. The ORDINARY WORLD is Jake’s new home on an alien moon and attempting to fill his twin brother’s scientist shoes as an uneducated military grunt who can’t use his legs. The THEME STATEMENT happens in minute 6, at the end of Quaritch’s introduction to the safety briefing. He says that “to survive… you have to obey the rules. Pandora rules.” The implication is that Pandora rules are different from any rules you’ll need to follow back on Earth. We will learn what Pandora rules are under the mentorship of Neytiri in the second act.

Blake Snyder (Save the Cat) expects a theme statement on page 5 of a script (exactly). This one is very close to the mark, and even Snyder might forgive its placement considering that this is a 2.5 hour film. Interestingly, the phrase “Pandora rules” is not present in the script that I have. And the placement of this dialogue from Quaritch happens at page 10. This suggests that there was heavy editing after filming that resulted in shaping the sequence to fit expected Hollywood story structure.

END OF SEQUENCE: The sequence thematically ends in the science lab, but Grace moves to a different location in the complex to confront the man in charge, Selfridge. This two minute long scene represents pure, unadulterated exposition. Exposition is a necessary evil that lives at the beginning of any film, like an unwanted guest. It’s best to get it out of the way as fast as possible, and, if possible, be as entertaining as you can while doing it. This scene, the “Unobtainium Scene”, happens at the end of the sequence, unfortunately. Also, the content of this awkward scene doesn’t fit within the theme(s) of the first sequence, i.e., the Man in the Box/Womb. But this scene also doesn’t fit the theme of the next sequence, which is ...

**Sequence 2 (14:00-24:00) “Your Real Legs”**

THEME: In this sequence Jake gets to run around in his avatar body, excitedly running free for the first time in a while. (NOTE: It’s not mentioned how long it’s been since Jake was injured and lost the use of his legs – we can assume it’s been some time due to his unfettered joy, but also not overly long because of how quickly he adapts, i.e. those afferent and efferent neural connections in his brain must not have totally atrophied. So his disability might have been for months, but probably not years). 

The final scene is my favorite in the whole movie. It’s a 3 minute longs scene that moves from a mini-gym where Quarith is at a bench press, to a cargo bay where he examines bipedal AMP suit before climbing aboard, and finally walking the mech away from its bay, before pointing at Jake’s legs with his mech arm and promising to get him spinal surgery when he returns to Earth.

So we start the movie looking at Jake as someone who was reborn, an infant. And sequence two finds Jake quickly learning to walk and experimenting with his new body, a toddler.

TIMING: This sequence is only 10 minutes long. But if we include the exposition scene between Selfridge and Grace then it does fill out at 12 minutes, so in keeping with a consistent pace. But that awkward scene is also one of those misplaced dominoes that breaks the chain. So the first real scene of sequence 2 has to get audiences back into a suspension of disbelief. Thankfully this sequence moves quickly to get Jake into his Avatar. At 2 minutes in (@ 16:00, or 20%) Jake wakes up inside his new giant body. Then he runs into Grace’s avatar at 5 minutes (@ 19:00, 50%) who is impressed by how quickly he has taken to this typically difficult skill (remember: he has less than an hour of experience in a link unit, as opposed to Norm’s 520 hours). This marks a change in their relationship, coinciding perfectly with the purpose of a midpoint. And finally at 7 minutes (@ 21:00, 70%) Jake meets with Quaritch who promises to get Jake his “real legs” back. 

The low point (also known as the All is Lost moment) doesn’t always mean that the main character is at their lowest point in the story. In fact, some story choices include using false lows and false highs, inverting the typical dramatic structure of rising and falling action. But in character-driven work the low point coincides with a separation of the main character from their dynamic (typically this separation is artificially or externally generated). In this sequence Jake’s dynamic is Grace, who ushers him into the link unit, then meets him, playfully, at the midpoint, and then shepherds him to a cabin where all of the avatars sleep. When Jake exits the link and the science lab, he is separated from his dynamic (Grace). This marks the low point of the sequence. Grace will continue to be Jake’s dynamic until Neytiri takes over the role in sequence 4.

SETUPS: There’s a glaring, problematic setup introduced in sequence 2 that never pays off! But 5 of the 6 total setups do resolve satisfactorily:

Sequence 2 Setup

1. There are MANY avatars! (where are they in the end?).
No.

3. “Not the biggest thing flying out there”.
Yes.

5. Jake’s double agent role – will it be revealed?
Yes.

2. Tendrils at the end of his avatar’s ponytail.
Yes.

4. “Recon gyrene in an avatar body… goosebumps”.
Yes.

6. Promise to get Jake his real legs.
Yes.

JOURNEY STAGE: Here we expect an INCITING INCIDENT. This is the offer, the CALL TO ADVENTURE, that gives the main character an opportunity to escape their unsatisfactory routine. The inciting Incident happens near the end of this sequence, at 23:00, when Quartich asks Jake to “learn these savages from the inside… gain their trust.” Quaritch needs to know, “how to force their cooperation or hammer them hard if they won’t.” He asks Jake to quietly use his military recon training to provide intel, discreetly and directly to Quaritch, while pretending to serve the needs of the science team. Jake is happy to oblige. Happy to obey an order from a military superior.

This is strange! Here is where that Unobtainium Scene rears its ugly head again. Blake Snyder expects the Inciting Incident (the Catalyst, in Save the Cat) at 10% of the way into the story, i.e., at minute 12 of a 2 hour movie, or at minute 15 of a 2.5 hour movie. That out of place exposition scene happens exactly where most moviegoers have been subconsciously trained to expect the Inciting Incident. The reason for that placement is to allow the 2nd half of the 1st act to play out a debate phase. The main character of a story (typically) is supposed to be an avatar for the rest of us! And almost all of us would ignore the call to adventure, or at least kick that can down the road for an interminable amount of time. Dorothy is easily dissuaded from running away by a charlatan fortune teller. Neo refuses the call to adventure twice before taking the red pill. But these heroes, either by an appeal to their mental splinter (Neo) or by freak tornado, end up walking across the threshold, or being dragged across it. And this is why movies even exist! It’s so that we can vicariously cross the threshold into a dangerous new place that will challenge our worldview and our comfortable routines. Almost none of us would do it.

In Avatar Jake says yes to the call without hesitation. Maybe it’s understandable: he had already journeyed for years to reach Pandora, even before the very first frame of the film. From his point of view he has already crossed the greatest threshold of his life. Every other decision is minor in comparison. And, just as Jake directly said in a voice over during the safety briefing, he finds comfort in military customs. So taking part in military operations is the easier path for him. And maybe that’s why the Inciting Incident is allowed to happen so late in the sequence. 

END OF SEQUENCE: The audience is primed to expect a first meeting with the Na’vi. But everything else about that interaction is left unclear. (The storytellers are more concerned with revealing information bit by bit and in the moment, as opposed to setting up a framework of specific expectations.)

**Sequence 3 (24:00-36:00) “Strong Heart… But Ignorant, Stupid Like a Child”**

THEME: This expression of the theme is dialogue that Neytiri voices in sequence 4. I find that it is an accurate observation of Jake’s behavior in sequence 3. And since she clandestinely tracks Jake through the forest for some time before intervening, she’s an absolutely objective authority here. Jake’s adventure in this sequence begins when he strays from the science team and carelessly whacks at the plantlife, being very pleased with their immediate mechanical response and the THWUMP sound that comes with their recoil. He acts like a child in a toy store (and a child is easily capable of imagining a museum as a toy store). Respect and reverence take time to cultivate so Jake is portrayed as an immature and rambunctious child. He then childishly taunts the Hammerhead Titanotheres before running for his life from the panther-like predator (Thanator). Then after he is abandoned by the science team, Jake finds himself in over his head waving a simple stick around hoping against hope to survive an extremely unfamiliar territory. 

So the succession of themes coincide with (1) an infant being born, (2) a toddler learning to walk, and (3) a child running around recklessly.

TIMING: After the science crew lands in the rainforest, Jake wanders off on his own at about the 3 minute mark (@ 27:00, 25%). A pretty arrogant Jake confronts a Thanator (giant, 6-legged panther-like beast) at 6 minutes (@ 30:00, 50%) and then flees for his life, boldly leaping over a cliff into a rushing stream to escape the predator. Then at 9 minutes (@ 33:00, 75%) the science team is forced to return to base, stranding Jake in the rainforest for the entire night. This sequence is mostly plot driven once the thanator arrives. But at night, when Jake is trying to survive alone we witness a mix of his courage as well as his inelegant, clumsy handling of the terrain and its wildlife, and in particular Viperwolves. 

SETUPS: I noticed 5 setups, and they all pay off eventually:

Sequence 3 Setups

1. Electrical signals transduction in tree roots.
Yes.

2. Hammerhead beasts.
Yes.

3. Thanator (apex predator).
Yes.

4. Viperwolves.
Yes.

5. Eywa’s seedlings.
Yes.

I only just noticed while writing this that the Thanator payoff is a parallel to Jake’s bonding with a Toruk. When Neytiri bonds with the Thanator she is creating another legendary-level pairing. It’s just that the Na’vi never mention the beast. It doesn’t seem to be a part of their culture, unlike the messiah-like mythology of the Toruk Macto.

JOURNEY STAGES: Sequence 3 is where we expect the main character to CROSS THE THRESHOLD and enter the INVERTED WORLD. There is a pseudo-crossing event when Jake lands in the rainforest with the rest of the science team. The strange flora or Pandora certainly represents part of the Inverted World. However, this is just part of the job – part of the Ordinary World. Rather it is his choice to wander from the group and get into trouble, ultimately finding himself separated from the safety of the group and roaming the alien world alone at night – that’s when Jake truly enters a new world. He has no knowledge of this terrain, the animals, or the rules he needs to survive the night. I’d say the Threshold Crossing happens at 33:00, when he is stranded. But, cinematically the Crossing of the Threshold is commonly associated with crossing through or over a stream of water – a metaphorical wall dividing the two distinct worlds. Jake crosses such a stream when he dives off the cliff while escaping the Thanator. This happens just over a minute before the crew returns to base, at 31:45. Either choice works.

END OF SEQUENCE: There is a mini-deus ex-machina in the last few minutes of the sequence. Even before getting surrounded by Viperwolves, Jake’s life is spared by a floating seedling (what Neytiri will refer to as a woodsprite) that lands on Neytiri’s arrowhead, which she has trained on Jake. What is the significance of this woodsprite? What granted Jake clemency? We’ll find out pretty much immediately, as the next sequence starts with a bang, mid-scuffle.

BEFORE we move on the 2nd Act, a quick note/recap on Act 1. Dan Harmon (Community, Rick and Morty) says that the first half of Act 1 typically has feminine, maternal qualities. The same goes for the first half of each story segment (i.e., sequences 1, 4, 7, 10). Whereas, the second half of each segment is characterized by more masculine, paternal qualities. Notice how in the first sequence Jake is introduced like a newborn babe and we see his avatar suspended in an amniotic fluid-like substance. And by the end of the act, in sequence 3, Jake is stumbling around, wandering on his own, touching things he shouldn’t and provoking fights with animals that are much larger than him. 

At least through the first 36 minutes of the movie Cameron and gang have been mostly respecting conventional Hollywood rules of storytelling. We’ve averaged 12 minutes per sequence, staying right on pace. In fact, using an objective assessment scheme (of my own creation) sequence 3 is nearly flawless in its structure. The only thing missing is the presence of the antagonist: Quaritch. The animals serve as stand-in opposition, but they don’t actively try to interfere with his character progression or his goal, i.e., to infiltrate the Na’vi. They’re more like obstacles than they are antagonistic. Antagonists are usually battling the protagonist over the same objective, just coming at it from different world views. These animals don’t give a damn about Jake’s mission, or his internal want or need.

**Sequence 4 (36:00-49:00) “Eywa’s Seed”**

THEME: This sequence is all about Jake reaching sexual maturity. Yep. And it’s pretty much irrefutable. Now, oddly, this is represented from a feminine perspective, in keeping with Dan Harmon’s rule. Neytiri’s attitude is to get away as soon as possible from Jake, until a swarm of seedlings surround Jake. This may be specifically because I’m also a biologist, but this imagery is unmistakable (to me!) in its reminiscence to sperm surrounding an ovum. That’s a significant moment for Neytiri who calls this a sign from Eywa. Confounded by this she leads Jake to Hometree to meet her parents. On the way she protects Jake from her presumptive boyfriend. Jake awkwardly introduces himself to Eytukan as soon as he finds out that he’s Neytiri’s father. And Neytiri reacts like a teenage girl when her mother, Mo’at declares that Neytiri will mentor Jake so he can learn their clan’s customs. 

To update the thematic progression of the sequences: (1) infant, (2) toddler, (3) child, (4) teenager. Jake is growing up quickly.

TIMING: At around 4 minutes (40:30-41:45, 35% into the sequence) the woodsprites swarm Jake. Neytiri protects Jake from Tsu’tey at 6.5 minutes in (@ 42:30, 50%). After Jake is brought to Hometree he introduces himself to Neytiri’s father, Eytukan, at 9 minutes (@ 45:20, 72%). Eytukan’s first instinct is to kill Jake, which is exactly what I’d expect from the father of a teenage girl. 

The mention or reference to death is a common way to mark a Hero’s Journey stage called The Whiff of Death, which coincides with the low point. So instead of using dynamic separation as the act 3 break, or a big low, or a false high, another valid option is to actually have something die, or get very close to having something die. In this case Jake almost serves as his own sacrificial lamb. 

While we’re on the topic…

JOURNEY STAGE: After Crossing the Threshold, and entering the Inverted World, the main character should meet the individual that should serve as their dynamic for the subsequent 6 sequences, or the middle 50% of the story. The DYNAMIC INTRODUCTION happens immediately. Neytiri interceding to save Jake from the viperwolves begins the second Act and sequence 4. She not only saves his life in a dramatic fashion, but she immediately starts teaching Jake some of the fundamental ways of the Na’vi. For example, (1) the concept of  “seeing” that somehow evades “sky people” (what the Na’vi call human beings), (2) the Na’vi try their utmost to avoid unnecessary killing of animals, (3) giving respect to animals killed & (4) there are holy signs having to do with rare natural phenomena. These proto-lessons represent a few of the 9 setups I discovered in this sequence:

SETUPS: 8 of the 9 pay off:

Sequence 4 Setups

1. Fire = antithetical to the rainforest.
No.

2. Giving respect to killed animals.
Yes.

3. Learning to ‘see’.
Yes.

4. Direhorse bond.
Yes.

5. Hometree size.
Yes.

6. Toruk skull.
Yes.

7. No dreamwalkers allowed at Hometree.
Yes.

8. Eytukan thinks about killing Jake.
Yes.

9. Norm’s Jealousy.
Yes.

END OF SEQUENCE: Jake has been given a blessing by Neytiri’s mother to learn the customs of the Omaticaya clan. We also learned from Neytiri’s father that dreamwalkers, aka avatars, are not allowed at Hometree, so this is a very special and unexpected accomplishment for the science team. Naturally they celebrate the moment at the mess hall with a jealous Norm seething on the sidelines. This jealousy won’t amount to much, burning with the heat of a petty teenage sibling rivalry. But it is obvious to the audience that the next sequence will have something to do with Jake having to learn a whole bunch of new things about the Na’vi…

**Sequence 5 (49:00-1:00:00) “The Bond” or “Sex Ed”**

THEME: … or maybe just one thing. Neytiri calls this Tsaheylu (shahaylu in the script). The tendrils at the end of his ponytail connect with corresponding tendrils of compatible beasts, like the direhorse that Tsu’tey was riding in the prior sequence. Through this connection their two minds are united. A rider can feel the strength in the muscles of the beast, and communicate to it through thought alone. Neytiri uses the relatively safe space of a meadow, almost like a corral, to mentor Jake in how to use his body in concert with another body. Earlier, in sequence 2, Grace warned Jake not to play with the tendrils or he’ll “go blind,” clearly making an allusion to you know what. Now, in this sequence he’s encouraged to use it.

To recap, from the top: Jake (1) is an infant, (2) is a toddler, (3) is a child, (4) reaches puberty, (5) is a teenager being sat down for “the talk.”

TIMING: After getting a quick refresh on the names of the key members of the Omaticaya Jake links back with his avatar and joins Neytiri at 3 minutes (52:00, 27%). Then after failing to bond with a direhorse returns to base where he provides intel to Quaritch. But Grace suspects interference from the Colonel and at 6 minutes (55:00, 55%) moves the science team to a remote station at the Hallelujah mountains. Then at 8.5 minutes (57:35, 77%) Jake uses the least glitchy link at the old station to get back to Neytiri. She leads Jake up to a high, isolated branch where she shows off her bond to an Ikran. This scene serves a double purpose: (1) to tease Jake with the possibilities of tsaheylu and (2) as an analogy to a teenage girl taking a boy up to her room.

There is a second, potentially stronger THEME running through this sequence, although it’s slightly more superficial and plot-focused. That theme is Hometree. At 30 seconds in Quaritch and Selfridge show the dense unobtainium deposits underneath Hometree and ask Jake to find a way to negotiate with the Na’vi to leave the tree. Then just before the midpoint Jake reports intel on Hometree to Quartich. And finally, Neytiri leads Jake up to a higher branch on Hometree so she can show off her Ikran.

SETUPS: 5 out of 6 setups pay off:

Sequence 5 Setups

1. Tsaheylu bonding with beasts.
Yes.

2. Jake giving Quaritch intel on Hometree.
Yes.

3. A glitchy link unit.
No.

4. Floating mountains.
Yes.

5. Jake will fly via Ikran bonding.
Yes.

6. Ikran (Neytiri) bond is for life.
Yes.

Unfortunately, the warning that the link units at the Hallelujah mountains are relatively glitchy never factors into the story.

JOURNEY STAGE: FUN & GAMES should start very quickly once Act 2 starts. One could argue for a variety of candidate moments that officially start Fun & Games in sequence 4 or 5. But I’ll argue that Fun & Games doesn’t properly start until the beginning of sequence 6 with a montage that demonstrates Jake’s progressive stages of adaptation. This sequence (5) instead spends half of its time showing Jake interacting with the science team or with Quaritch and Selfridge. The rule of thumb for this Journey Stage is that the poster image for the movie is usually pulled from Fun & Games. I haven’t seen a poster of Jake falling off a direhorse. But to be fair, Avatar’s theatrical posters of Na’vi faces split down the middle are not very scene-specific.

END OF SEQUENCE: It’s never explicitly stated, but Neytiri’s solo flight on her Ikran is meant to show Jake the level he can reach if he sticks to his lessons. More importantly she says tsaheylu with an Ikran is different than with a horse. That “once tsaheylu is made, Ikran will fly with only one Hunter in the whole life”. This is really about Neytiri. A bond with an Ikran is the same as a bond with her. So Neytiri is telegraphing to Jake the way into her heart. Unfortunately for Jake that means that he’ll have to risk death many times in order to win her heart.

In addition, the entire sequence provides a blueprint for the events that will take place in the next sequence: (1) first accomplish something simple on the ground, (2) ascend the Hallelujah mountains, (3) interact with Ikran. So we get subtle clues about what’s to come in sequence 6, but I don’t think it’s done in a way that makes the upcoming stakes and circumstances obvious to the audience.

**Sequence 6 (1:00:00-1:13:00) “Do or Die” or “The Path to Her Heart is Perilous”**

THEME: Jake’s voiceover during the montage lets us know that Neytiri told him that the operating mantra is “Learn Fast or Die”. But we’re shown that around 30 video logs are recorded during that 3.5 minute long stretch, so “fast” is a stretch. However, when the proper Road of Trials begins, and Jake is led to an Ikran rookery among the floating mountains, every step is potentially lethal, and he was not trained at all ahead of time for any of it. Death is certainly at the heart of this sequence: (1) Jake is taught about the flow of energy, with all things returning to Eywa, (2) the test he passes involves getting a clean kill on an animal and showing it the proper respect, (3) the path to the rookery is perilous, (4) Jake identifies his Ikran as the one that will try to kill him, and (5) to seal the bond with an Ikran they have to dive off a cliff and figure out the partnership as they plummet to their deaths.

Ultimately this entire, life-threatening process is less about earning a chance to join the Omaticaya clan, and more to do with winning Neytiri’s heart: once a bond is made with an Ikran, then that Ikran will only take on that one Na’vi rider for the rest of their lives. It’s a lifelong pairing. But there’s 3 steps before even getting that opportunity: (i) perform a clean kill, (ii) survive the climb to a rookery, (iii) don’t get killed by your Ikran. Remember, when Neytiri first saw Jake, her first instinct was to kill him. The parallels are overwhelming: Ikran = Neytiri.

There is a break in the chain of sequences with themes clearly centered on the successive stages of maturity. *If I were to force the concept further however,* this sequence would be like a teenager going through the process of getting their driver’s license. There’s a whole lot of trust that needs to be built up before the teen is allowed behind a wheel. And those first scary moments feel like life or death. This sequence is more like how dramatic a teenager makes every new life decision – like it’s the end of the world. Their first crush is the one… the only one. They would die for them. Etc.

TIMING: After a hefty montage Neytiri witnesses Jake perform a clean kill and declares that he is ready. This happens at 5 minutes into the sequence (1:05:00, 38%). Jake survives the climb and reaches the doorstep to the rookery at 7.5 minutes (1:07:20, 56%), achieving the first outward goal of the sequence. He then finds and fights with his Ikran which throws him over the ledge – a whiff of death moment – at 10.5 minutes (1:10:30, 81%). Neytiri is with him every step of the way, serving as a strong dynamic, and also as his ultimate objective, or his inward goal.

SETUPS: 3 of 3 setups pay off:

Sequence 6 Setups

1. Flow of energy; energy returns to Eywa.
Yes.

2. Over 30 logs = 1 month has passed?
Yes.

3. First flight seals the bond.
Yes.

JOURNEY STAGE: At the sixth sequence, fast approaching the Midpoint Turn (or Twist), a ROAD OF TRIALS is expected. And this Hero’s Journey stage is clearly present. After an abbreviated Fun & Games montage culminating in a test of his hold on basic customs Jake is quickly led on an insane hike up to the Hallelujah Mountain (presumably suspended by the superconductive properties of Unobtainium*) where he faces death nearly every step of the way. The climb culminates with a battle that takes place on the precarious edge of a cliff. And the final stage of the battle is leaping off that cliff and having to learn how to cooperate with an unfamiliar beast mid-plummet, or die very quickly.

The MIDPOINT TWIST is when the main character achieves their first outward goal. And here, by successfully bonding with an Ikran, Jake earns the opportunity to join the Omaticaya clan, to become one of them, an equal. So, structurally, Cameron and his team of editors have almost completely faithfully adhered to the Hollywood form.

??A question that only just occurred to me: if the ground under Hometree is the most dense concentration of unobtainium so far discovered, why isn’t that patch of earth floating???

END OF SEQUENCE: Jake quickly learns how to communicate and control his Ikran before falling to his death. Neytiri jumps on her own Ikran and joins Jake on his first flight. We don’t concretely know the consequence of this moment, and what we should expect from the subsequence sequence (7). However, just before Neytiri pushes Jake and his new Ikran off the cliff, she lets him know that the first flight seals the bond. So when Neytiri joins him on his flight, he is also sealing the bond with her. Therefore, this full final minute of the sequence initiates a type of pseudo-Meeting with the Goddess stage, another component of the Hero’s Journey that typically happens immediately after the midpoint. Oddly, however, the next sequence does not coincide with a true Meeting of the Goddess stage! Cinematically the Meeting with the Goddess follows the first kiss (see La La Land), or more commonly, once the romantic leads make love (see Titanic). In both those movies the “love scene” happens exactly at the midpoint. So if the end of this sequence doesn’t qualify as a midpoint, then what comes next? The implication is that there are more steps left before Neytiri becomes officially attainable to Jake. So what does Jake have left to do?

NOTE: Only on my most recent rewatch did I notice that when Jake was wrestling with the Ikran, Neytiri had a hand on her knife. She only took her hand off her knife once Jake successfully made the bond. What was she doing? All of the other Na’vi were either laughing at him (cough-Tsu’tey-cough), or trying to encourage him. Was she prepared to kill the Ikran to keep Jake safe? What would have been the consequence of that action? Does it go against any of their rules?

Are the Tul'kuh immortal?,2,10nvnmv,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/10nvnmv/are_the_tulkuh_immortal/,4,"I noticed rewatching the movie that Jake references their ""endless"" migration cycle.  You could say that it just means that it goes on for generations, but so does every kind of cyclical behavior.  So ""endless"" is a pretty redundant word, UNLESS, they live forever and thus they themselves will do it endlessly.  Plus we know the gold juice in their heads stops human aging.  You've got to assume that it performs a similar function for the Tul'kun.  So do they live forever unless killed?  Makes their huntings even more sad if it's true.

"Yes, James Cameron, You Can and Should Fix Neteyam",0,11byjx5,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/11byjx5/yes_james_cameron_you_can_and_should_fix_neteyam/,24,"**SPOILERS!**

The brilliance of TWOW, like Avatar, is that its story and characters have connected with people across backgrounds, geographies, and life experiences—for different reasons.

Clearly Neteyam has struck a chord with people—myself included. A chord that took James Cameron by surprise?>! (“Well, he’s dead.”)!< Folks can continue to debate their reasons why and Neteyam’s value as a character in TWOW. But I’m not here to convince you. It’s irrelevant to the point at hand—Neteyam is a beloved character and fans want to see his story continue with the Sully family. This is a story about family after all. Neteyam can and should be a consequential part of the Avatar saga's future.

JC’s recent fan Q&A sessions appears genuine—its never been done before. Jim wants to hear directly from fans to make 3 and the saga better for us—again, the fans. If not for his legacy or ambition, then to create experiences that positively change peoples behavior or perspective of the real world.

Well, time and again fans have expressed that Neteyam IS an important character to them. If JC is sincere—as I believe he is—he can and should listen to bring Neteyam legitimately back into the saga. If nothing else but respect for those multiple-viewing fans that made the TWOW #3 movie of all time. (Not to mention A1 #1)

I’m under no illusions. Avatar 3 is 95% filmed and in post-production—major changes are impractical, minor ones possible. Writing 4 scripts and filming 2 movies sequentially limits the ability to adapt to unanticipated fanbase reactions. But the simple existence of JC’s Q&A in itself proves changes can be made or what was the point?

Admittedly, resurrecting Neteyam in A3 would nullify conflict in the film arising from his fate, unless as an ending cliffhanger. (\*queue eyes opening like Jake). He will at least be in flashbacks because part of TWOW act 1 is now act 1 of A3 (Stated by JC). JC can satisfy fans in A3 by including as many Neteyam scenes as coherently possible. >!Narratively, the Sully family, especially Lo’ak, should still be grieving.!<

Neteyam CAN be resurrected in Avatar 4 and 5. The scripts are written but not filmed or completely casted. (Act 1 of 4 is supposedly done,  and before a narrative time jump, so shouldn’t matter) Things can change.

We don’t know the extend of Eywa's or Kiri’s power or Navi rituals. Are there “dark” rituals? ( ie necromancy) Can the RDA extract memories from spirit trees? (Well they can from living humans) Can human allies like Dr. Max Patel create new Avatar bodies? (Im inclined to think so) What is the afterlife truly like? Can Eywa create life on her own? (She IS Pandora—Of course she can!)

>!(I’ll just say now if Spider gets an Avatar body just to progress the relationship with Kiri—that adds insult to injury.)!<

All intriguing questions that provide an explanation as how Neteyam could narratively be brought back. Brought back simply because “Sullys stick together”, and for the love and loss of a son and brother that no amount of reliving memories can heal. What sacrifices does that present? Does Jake/Neytiri/Lo’ak need to compromise their morality, or their very being in that pursuit? Do they ally with the enemy to that end? Love does strange things to people.

Or for more nefarious purposes. He's brought back to combat, and emotionally torture/scar Jake/Neytiri/Lo’ak by RDA or the Ash clan. A twisted Neteyam with corrupted memories that eventually leads to redemption. Talk about development…Claiming there is no story is disingenuous. Audiences crave their happy endings—JC should know this better than most.

Yes, Neteyam can and should come back—but will James Cameron listen? Myself and many fans genuinely hope so.",1677366209.0
"Avatar 2 story is horrible and takes away from the original, which was perfectly fine",0,1023x9d,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/1023x9d/avatar_2_story_is_horrible_and_takes_away_from/,17,"Me and my dad loved the first one and are fans of Cameron, but Avatar 2 really dropped the ball when it comes to story. Now don't get me wrong, visually it looked fantastic and it had great ideas, but compared to the first one, it has the writing level of modern Star Wars if not worse.

What I enjoyed about the first one is the implication that Humans could at any point mop the floor with the Na'vi - be it with chemical warfare, biological or even scorched earth, but the main threat was a corporation that probably had to deal with a lot of red tape. In the end I assumed ""Their Planet is dying"" line was metaphorical/spiritual

Instead Earth was literally dying so Earth started to colonize it. Fair enough and the beginning was promising with how overwhelming Earth was and nothing can stop it

But then re-introduction to dead characters was done for no other reason other than their familiarity and personal connections with sci fi mumbo jumbo that opens a giant can of worms. What is to stop them from cloning 10 colonels instead of just 1? Especially given that they can use only 1 template for DNA. Why those mercenary grunts specifically? We know Avatars are hyper expensive so it is a weird investment 

And now humans have the tech to essentially become immortal. Who needs whale juice when we can simply clone ourselves and avatar ourselves to a brand new young body - Human or otherwise

Also why are they chasing Jake again? Personal vengeance? He was running scared and they could do what they want, but they actively chase him - why? Last time Na'vi won against roughly 1000 mercs and it took everything they had, but now humans are serious. 

Also what was the logic for only Jake leaving in the first place. If he was worried that the base is compromised, why didn't the others leave too?

By far the worst aspect of the story was every time there was a hostage situation it was handled amateurishly bad and very atypical of Cameron. They threaten to start killing hostages and demand surrender. Jake starts walking in to surrender and something unexpected happens and they start ignoring the hostages for a while until the plot conveniently reminds them that they have the upper hand. This happens like 3 times. 

Remember how an entire volley of arrows were useless vs the helicopters in the first one? This movie doesn't. Humans are horribly handicapped, because the plot says so.  

Lastly Cameron went full blown modern Star Wars writing level when writing aliens who use phrases like creep and in general the water tribe people having very similar human behavior and phrases, as well J.J. Abrams mystery box bullshit with who is the father for the blue girl and maybe a who is the mother for the human boy.

The first one did a perfect balance of what to say and not say. A lot of assumptions could be made as to why X didn't happen (Humans wiping the Na'vi), or why Z is important (unobtainium). This movie fell flat on it's face for almost every single explanation and event. The more it explained, the more non sensical it was. As a result we now know that humans can be explained away in the first movie as incompetent fools, because that is what we got with the ""serious"" humans in Avatar 2.

""Who's got the harpoon now"" - Saw it twice, no one even snorted air. Not only is it not funny, no one would say that in a life/death situation, it ruins the tension. Feels like some boomer saw a Marvel film and wanted to include a zinger just cause. Ruined the legacy/overall film and it's consistency by a lot.

&nbsp;

* Forest Setting > Water Setting slightly, but still cool.

&nbsp;

* Zoomer Lingo (Bro, Cuzz) was noticeable and funny to poke fun at. 

&nbsp;

* Jake's ""You've done enough"" line to Loak after Neteyam's death was horrible. What, are you trying to make your kid hate himself for the rest of his life, right after the death of his older brother? He's a kid, you're a father. Take responsibility, not blame the kid.

&nbsp;

* Jake's decision to leave the Omatikaya is the biggest character inconsistency in the movie. Ask yourself genuinely - after seeing Avatar 1, knowing who Jake is, him being savvy, how much he knows about human behavior and then how important the traditions are and what they mean to Neytiri - he should know that his decision would never work in the long-term, and he'd have to take up arms. In fact, that's literally the conclusion he comes to at the end of the movie. Jake that the audience knows would never have needed this movie to 'show him' that. Decision was probably made just so we could have a new environment to explore.

&nbsp;

* Scenes with Humans and Spider took you out of the magic just slightly. Arguably, mixed scenes with humans/Na'Vi looked more jarring than the first one for some reason.

&nbsp;

* Neteyam Flashback at the end hits hard emotionally, especially on 2nd watch.

&nbsp;

* First movie is a bit better purely due to a more cohesive plot and being more consistent, but might change depending on the execution of the next films in the trilogy.

I think the na’vi might be the baddies…,0,14fkhvh,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/14fkhvh/i_think_the_navi_might_be_the_baddies/,53,"Firstly, I’ve only seen the movies, so please enlighten me if there’s important lore I’m missing.

I’m here to say that the na’vi are backward savages, and that the RDA is perfectly justified in forcing them out of the way of their human betters.

Firstly, the na’vi are entirely unreasonable, and the RDA made every effort at diplomacy and peace with them. It was only when they realized that the primitives would never agree upon any solution, that they resorted to force. Parker says they’ve built the na’vi schools and roads, given them medicine, education. Even when attack is authorized, Quarich first proposes driving the na’vi out with gas to minimize casualties. Even right before the attack, Parker gives Jake yet another chance to get the na’vi to evacuate. How do the na’vi respond to the warning? They tie him and Grace up and hold knives to their throats. When the attack begins, only the marines remotely enjoy it. Watching Home Tree burn on the screens, none of the humans take pleasure what they had to do. The na’vi had every chance to compromise and negotiate. Just goes to show that you can teach a Smurf English, but violence is the only language it truly understands.

Now, in the second film, it’s said that earth is dying. I don’t really know what that means or how floaty rock can fix it. From what I understand of the hypothetical material tho, it basically just lets them build more spaceships, which I still think is reason enough to wipe out these savages. Cheap space travel would allow for untold prosperity. It would allow for people to leave an overpopulated planet and branch out, allowing for further diversity as cultures that would normally be drowned out by the supermajority could flourish on their own colonies. Resources from asteroids and other planets would bring untold prosperity, and sensors would provide invaluable scientific data.

The na’vi have an extremely primitive and barbaric culture, with mating pairs being arranged by social class or chosen by the male. Jake may have asked Neytiri, but she never really had a choice. Probably why she left him to die on the sacrificial altar, and only apologized when he pulled up on the legendary dragon.

And about that neural bond thing… I read on the wiki that it’s an important it’s an important part of na’vi mating, and it’s suggested that the queue is an especially sensitive part of their bodies. Looking at na'vi clothes, they only consistently cover two parts of their bodies, their junk, and their queues. Just watching the process of how na’vi tame animals is sus too. They physically wrangle the animal until they can force their queue into the animal's, and integrate with their mind directly, at which point the animal gets super Stockholm Syndrome and is willing to die for its new master. I mean, we’re watching the same thing, right? This is downright fucked on every level. The na’vi literally go around forcing themselves onto the bodies and minds of every animal and plant they come across. It wasn’t okay in Evangelion, and it’s not okay here. And that’s only about half of what I want to say on the matter. A pandoran neural bond is undeniably an extremely intimate act, as two creatures meld their minds together, effectively momentarily becoming one. I recognize that it’s not exactly 1 for 1 with any behaviors on earth, but when we consider the rationale behind why we condemn intimacy with animals or children of our own species and compare that to the relationship dynamics between na’vi and the animals they force themselves on, it becomes extremely disturbing.

Interesting how Eywa let untold numbers of na’vi die throughout their prehistory, and only lent aid when Jake warned it that it itself was in danger… almost like the planet god also recognizes the na’vi’s lives as worthless, and it only acted at all, out of self-preservation.

Imagine if they were human… each sitting upon billions of dollars and claiming whole kilometers of unused land and valuable resources as their own, while the rest of society starves. Resources that they inherited from their parents, rather than worked for, and that have the potential to save countless lives and even grant downright immortality. Would government intervention not be justified?

Really the RDA’s biggest mistake was trusting some unqualified sex tourist to head diplomatic relations. Jake says in the beginning that he only came to Pandora because he was sick of doctors telling him what he couldn’t do. He just came here to live out some kind of power fantasy and regain control of his life. Then while there, he gets completely sidetracked and “falls in love” with one of the natives. Like I said before, Neytiri had no say in the matter. Add to that, that Jake comes from a completely different world. She doesn’t know anything about him or what he is. They’re fundamentally different, and I’d go as far as to call it straight up grooming that he would manipulate her into mating with him, while he’s literally leading a double life in a fake body and with many times the sophistication and knowledge she has. Again, not a 1 to 1, but we have a pretty similar concept here on earth, and it's vile what he's doing.

I’d also like to address some things I saw others say about this matter…

First, that the avatar program was a last resort to pacify the na’vi without having to commit much to dealing with them. I find this unlikely, considering in the first movie, an avatar body is “insanely expensive,” enough so that they’d involve an unqualified, unknown, third party so that just one of them doesn’t go to waste. It was also said that Jake’s brother trained for 3 years for this mission, and that the avatars were grown on the flight over, which took 6 years, so the RDA invested at minimum 9 years to this diplomatic effort. And again, even throughout the movie the RDA was trying to find any alternative to active conflict with the na'vi, all the way up until the attack started. Wiping them out is the last resort, and even through the second film, where it would be as simple as doing donuts with the ISVs, they’re still holding off on it.

I also saw someone say basically that the RDA doesn’t care about humanity and is only doing this for profit. And ye, they are. That doesn’t change the outcome, that being significant advancement to outright continued existence for humanity as a whole. Just because a good deed is compensated doesn’t make it less valuable.

People like to say something along the lines of “if someone came into your house and started taking your stuff, you’d retaliate too.” Which is a terrible analogy, since first, the RDA doesn’t what what’s in the house but what’s under it. And in this analogy, I’ve have been approached multiple times with offers of compensation and given straight up donations. The government can also just straight up do that through eminent domain. So no, I wouldn’t retaliate, and if I instigated a shootout with the construction workers, then I'd get what I deserve.

Another goofy argument I’ve seen is that the RDA can’t bomb the planet from orbit for “logistic reasons.” So I did some napkin math to see what would happen if they simply detached one of the Valkyrie shuttles whilst at the ISV’s highest speed approaching Pandora. The Valkyrie doesn’t have an official weight as far as I can tell, so I substituted it for a Boeing C-17 Gobblemaster III, which weighs 282,400 lbs. Using that and the ISV’s top speed of 209,500 km/s to calculate its kinetic energy, then converting that into yield, we get 855,734,591 kilotons of TNT. When putting this into NukeMap, we get an error because that’s over 8,000x the maximum yield for that program. It’s also 14,000x the tsar bomba. Lemme remind you again that I didn’t even use the Valkyrie for this. The C-17 has a wingspan 30 meters shorter than the Valkyrie, and a length of almost half. Granted, I’m bad at math, so correct me if I’m wrong on this.

And that's the na'vi case for exterminatus. I'm truly appalled by how wrongly framed the humans are in this film. I hope you guys enjoyed and are finding yourselves coming to the side of civility and intimate relations only bing between consenting adults of the same species.

Also, just something I noticed, but when Jake narrates that na’vi speak sounds like English to him, one of the first things we here is “I hate you times infinity.” Why do the na’vi have a word for infinity, that they can use in a mathematical context?

Another random thing I noticed whilst rewatching these movies… where are the black people? Like seriously, what's going on with that?",1687384038.0
Na'vi Scientific Name: An Opinion,38,11nybpl,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/11nybpl/navi_scientific_name_an_opinion/,19,"I did some research, and as it turns out, the scientific name for the Na'vi is *Homo pandorus.* I actually do not think this name is appropriate for their species. The main reason is the use of *Homo* for their genus name. In latin, *homo* is a prefix meaning ""of the same"", (some examples include *homogeneous*, the name for mixtures containing a single substance, or *homosexual*, describing a same-sex relationship or preference). This is the term we use to describe the hominids, the great apes, due to their close relationship with our own species. More specifically, the genus name *Homo* was designated for the species of modern day humans, *Homo sapiens.* This genus also includes extinct human species, including *Homo habilis, Homo naledi,* and *Homo erectus* (save it for the comments).

In binomial nomenclature, both the genus and species name help biologists to specify exactly what species is being referred to. For example, imagine a scientist is observing a set of bones. Another person approaches and asks what species those bones belonged to. The scientist could simply say the species name, *rex,* as an answer, but there are multiple species that all share the species name *rex.* With binomial nomenclature, it can be specified whether the bones being observed belonged to *Tyrannosaurus rex,* or *Balaeniceps rex,* a.k.a. the African shoebill.

However, a genus name should really only be used to describe closely related species that are within a single taxonomic genus. *Panthera* is the genus name designated for a specific group of cats that all share a common ancestor, including the leopard (*Panthera pardus*), the lion (*Panthera leo*), and the tiger (*Panthera tigris*). To use the name *Panthera* for any species outside of this group would be illogical. (Slight tangent: This is the issue I have with the scientific names in Legendary's *Monsterverse.* The fact that Godzilla, Mothra, Kong, *and* Ghidorah \[who is an alien, mind you\] are all classified in the genus *Titanus,* despite not even being in the same *phylum* is just absurd.)

This is why I don't approve of the name *Homo pandorus* for the Na'vi. My issue is that using the genus name *Homo* to describe the Na'vi implies that they're in the same taxonomic genus as our own, which isn't the case. I understand the notion of wanting to use a scientific name similar to our own, seeing how the Na'vi are incredibly humanlike. My personal suggestion for their name, which I feel would help prevent confusion, would be *Navi sapiens.*",1678476439.0

My Theory: The Na'vi would need human avatars if they decided to come to earth,14,zzdd6w,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zzdd6w/my_theory_the_navi_would_need_human_avatars_if/,12,"There's a lingering theory about the 5th movie that the Na'vi will visit Earth and that it will be partly or entirely set there, but how will they do it? From the second movie, we already know that the Na'vi can breathe earth's air for at least several hours, but how could they tackle the much larger gravity of the planet? The Na'vi are strong, and Earth is (or was) full of creatures the size or even bigger than them, but there were some physiological differences that made those creatures capable to reach those sizes in our gravity which the Na'vi possibly lack completely. They were much bulkier and heavier than the Na'vi, who are quite dainty and lanky having evolved to endure much weaker gravitational pull and strain than that of Earth. We also know that in humans (to which the Na'vi are the most similar on Pandora), anyone above 6.5/7 feet in height will have a considerable amount of severe health problems due to the strain their body will have to endure from the added weight and height, and the Na'vi easily surpass that limit on average. So according to my theory, they would need humanlike genetically engineered avatars to be on Earth similar to how humans use Na'vi-like avatars on Pandora, just for different reasons. Pandora's atmosphere is lethal to humans, but they are fine with the weaker gravity, while the Na'vi are okay with Earth's atmosphere, but its gravity is what would likely kill them in the long or even short run in case they decided to visit the planet. I would be very interested to see how a mostly human-Na'vi hybrid avatar and the Na'vi characters would look like in human skin.

Eywa is AI and the Navi are actually…,0,1akyw1x,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/1akyw1x/eywa_is_ai_and_the_navi_are_actually/,10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/s/NRawLyCEN5

Happy that im not the only one is in Eywa is AI theory.
But, i also have a theory that the Na’vi are also bioengineered species that were created by an advance society that might also have created Eywa.
So basically this is all one ancient scientist’s work, probably to save his dying planet or kind. 
Isn’t it just convenient how Navi’s are basically hackable and they have connection ports conveniently like that. Along with all the flora and fauna in Pandora. But like low level creatures. The Navi are the highest species as stewards of the Pandora paradise.
Maybe something in the lines of how (going into MCU) Arishem created the Deviants and  the Eternals using the World Forge. And placed /sent his Eternals to Earth.
But a bit more scientifically logical in Avatar, since the genre of avatar is more science-y.
And this creator/scientist, is actually much closer to the kind of humans. Cause 
- it is a fact that from the 2009 movie, humans can culture a hybrid Navi body. Like all ethics aside, they able to genetically engineer a live Navi body and hack into its consciousness, making it a blank body set in a live connection (like wifi?) to a human brain so a human can control this Navi body as an Avatar
- eywa’s three rules are about avoiding the things that actually caused earth’s ecocide.
- this creator/scientist’s intentions are so humanlike. Make a bluish paradise world were everything is in harmony. No tech allowed, no unnatural violence. And blue skinned beings that glow in spots in the dark, like my LED light room setup. Ooh and the living creatures have connection ports, Tsaheylu is like USB-ultra. Or they could just connect via “blue”tooth. Haha sorry for the puns.
So, what Im saying is that maybe the origin of the Navi and Pandora maybe related or somehow connected to the people from Earth.",1707297028.0

A small question about na'vi anatomy.,695,1b80lgw,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1b80lgw,61," Honestly, I haven't seen any articles about what kind of crosses they have on their chests. This question has been tormenting me for a long time...
what is it? It doesn't look like a bone. it is clear that the na'vi skeleton is stronger than that of a human, but is this structure a more reliable structure? Is it cartilage? but, on the other hand, what do they need cartilage for?.. A muscle? It's also weird. 

I see a relationship with the fact that it is uniquely linked to gender. Women almost do not show this sign. But can it be like in the situation with adam's apple in men? (for some it is visible, for others it is almost invisible) 

moreover, the na'vi race does not greatly affect the presence of this muscle-bone-cartilage. Among the Metkayina, it is sometimes even more pronounced. Most likely, this is due to the fact that their chest is better developed due to swimming. 

As for the recom? They have it even more pronounced in some situations than avatars. Can human genes suppress this trait, like suppressing large eyes, a wide and flattened bridge of the nose, and other features? in both of Sally's sons, this is expressed well, while in Jake himself it is visible only in some moments (for example, when pulling a bowstring) 

what is it? A muscle? Cartilage? part of the skeleton? Is this a Scottish flag reference?..... (FORGIVE ME FOR THE LAST INSERTION, JAHAHA)",1709734159.0

"Personally, I found Unobtainium more believable than Amrita",509,13ze8sf,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/13ze8sf/personally_i_found_unobtainium_more_believable/,114,"While both were ultimately McGuffins, I still think Unobtainium was more believable and well-written than Amrita, for three reasons.

1. Unobtainium was established early in the film and we actually got to see it's properties in action and learn why humanity wanted it WITHOUT lots of exposition. In Selfridge's office, the chunk of the stuff is shown floating, so we know from the start that it floats. Thus, later when Jake's team travels to the Hallelujah Mountains and we see that they float, we can assume that they are full of Unobtainium. This explains why humanity wants the stuff so bad without explicitly explaining it. Amrita, meanwhile, wasn't established or brought up until halfway through the second film and we never see it in use, so there's a lot less credibility to it's importance.

2. Despite primarily being a McGuffin, Unobtainium actually played a practical part in the plot of the first film. It was established midway through that the stuff causes electrical systems to go haywire. This gave the Navi a significant advantage during the final battle because it prevented the RDA from using missile tracking. Amrita, aside from existing, had no baring on the plot or outcome of the second film.

3. This is more of a personal thing, but I find the idea of a reverse-magnetic superconductor to be more believable (or at least easier to buy) than anti-aging whale brain juice. The writers IMO went from psudoscience to straight-up magic.",1685801840.0

I can’t get over Neteyam and Neytiri,466,zpl2qa,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zpl2qa/i_cant_get_over_neteyam_and_neytiri/,106,"I have so many emotions about these two and I needed a place to shout about them. 

Neytiri has always been, imo, the most interesting character. Even before the first film, she’s lost so much—her sister, her home, her father, her betrothed mate. Life as she knew it. And she just keeps getting pushed in the second film, now leaving the forest and her people entirely only to watch her child die anyway. The neytiri we saw snap on the boat deck was not just because of her son. It was a culmination of every loss brought on by the humans she hates so much, all spurred on by the death of Neteyam. 

And Neteyam. NETEYAM. Does anyone else think about just how much his death SUCKED emotionally? It wrecked me. We saw him follow lo’ak’s plan in the train scene, which injured him and foreshadowed his death later on. Except in that instance, Jake could save Neteyam. In that instance, Lo’ak felt guilty but _he still had a brother to apologize to afterward_. 

And let’s not forget his last words to Jake: “I want to go home, Dad.” The son who was always aching to be in battle. The son who argued for his chance to fight alongside his father. The “I’m a warrior like you, I’m supposed to fight” golden boy realized at the end of his life that all he really wanted to do was go home and be safe because he was only a child and shouldn’t be in this position to begin with. 

Couple all of that with the absolutely BRUTAL way he was shot—I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay after that. 

With all this in mind I think back to Neytiri. Quaritch has been directly responsible for the death of two of her family members. I haven’t seen anyone else mention this, but to me it looks like Cameron is building up a rivalry not between Quaritch and Jake, but Quaritch and Neytiri. The emphasis on her arrows, the hostage negotiation, the fact that Neytiri is technically the one that killed Quaritch first anyway, it’s all leading up to them being the main rivals. I think Jake is merely a lens for us as the audience to be introduced to pandora, but ultimately the story will be about Neytiri.",1671434687.0

Why don't the humans use Fast Jets in Pandora?,415,13ud3k1,Avatar,https://i.redd.it/8yueypsrwo2b1.jpg,78,"Why don't the humans ship and build fast jets in Pandora. 

Jets come with Infra red cameras, precision guided munitions etc. 

They can run reconnaissance sorties as well as bombing and Air to dragon mission (RIP Ikrans) 

There are a few reasons thay I'll suggest, let me know if I'm right or if I've missed it:

The high maintenance cost of a fast jet is not worth it compared to helicopters (e.g maintenance, fuel) 

Something about the air means fast jet engines struggle to operate in the atmosphere as they fail to combust the air? 

James Cameron couldn't be arsed to add them in CGI

The Humans don't want to use full scale weapons of war and resort to helicopters as they can be used for transport as well as attack. 

The creation of an air strip would take too much space along with money and resources for ground crew and ATC. 

Jets aren't effective for Human operations, although they'd be ukillable and can provide ground support via Targetting camera, weapons. As well as a reliable way to kill ikran and their riders.

- She is a bad parent because there is a track called ""bad parent"".

- she endangers her children by letting the go through Iknimaya. Even though ut is literally a rite of passage and her husband THE OLO'EYKTAN thought they were ready. Please note, they have to go through it to become an adult and warrior. It isn't just a ""dangerous cultural tradition"", they live because the hunters hunt by ikran back. And they both delayed Lo'ak's Iknimaya after he fell, for another time.

- accusing her of encouraging them to go through Dream hunt IN THE FUTURE THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

- They blame her for the kids wandering about to plat, cause it's her job to keep an eye on them or ""instill safe behaviour in them"". They are teenagers who want to do what they feel like, can she control everything they do? She taught then to defend themselves and they can. Lo'ak made trouble and they almost died, is this anything new.

- ""She is also shown to have too much faith in them"". She taught them and expect them to apply it, is that not good parenting. Is she supposed to micro manage their lives. As 14 year old, they are almost Na'vi adults, they need to have the freedom to make choices, but they are young enough for their parents to be a safety net. Which they are.

- Spider being blamed does not make her a bad mother, because SHE IS NOT HIS MOTHER. Mary is. And she does punish her children. She is scared that a human (Though not his fault), will take her children's life as well. Though her anger is incorrectly directed, she is dealing with what she perceives as a threat to her kids. That makes her a good mother.

- She isn't being controlling she is protecting her babies in her own mind. And though Kiri's anger is warranted. Kiri and her mum disagreeing isn't bad. Parents and kids will have different opinions and feelings, this is fine and a normal part of growing up.

- Again why is Neytiri being blamed for Kiri trying to sneak out with Spider and Lo'ak and Tuk being captured. Kiri made the decision to disobey her mum. They could've had a discussion, but Kiri is a teenage girl growing up. She definitely thinks she knows all and her mum ""just doesn't get it"", like she didn't marry a human behind her parents back.

Lo'ak was disrespecting an Olo'eyktan in front of a group of Na'vi in a clan who is sheltering them from literal death. He could've waited and spoken later to him, but no he chose to disrespect a leader because he felt he was right regardless of the situation.

Neytiri having Jake's handprint as her warpaint,348,19femjs,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/19femjs,10,"I feel like we don't talk about Neytiri having Jakes handprint as a part of her warpaint in A1 enough.
This is so deep to me.

First of all, we can be sure it's Jakes, as it is too small for a human and only the Avatars have 5 fingers. The only Avatars that were at Na'vi war camp were Jake and Norm, and it's safe to assume that Norm didn't do this. 

1. We can assume that white handprints are a thing for war paint. Tsu'tey had them too in the final battle (just bigger and ""painted"" instead of ""pressed on""). So this is a traditional thing, but she still allowed a bit of human in it, in contrast to her hating EVERYTHING human at the start.
2. This means Jake was present when she painted herself. It's also very likely that she did his braids the day before that. He wasn't planning or equiping anyone at that morning, but took time to be with his wifey.
3. It's right above her heart and it is the same spot that Jake puts his hand after Neteyams death when he says ""They have our daughters"".
4. The most obvious one. It's a big f*ck you to all the human soldiers amd Quaritch. When they see her they are constantly being reminded that 'one of them' has turned against them and betrayed them.

But she is the most in tune with the planet, basically being Pandoran Jesus. She wants to be normal, but can't.  
The initial conflict for Spider is that he is different: In the eyes of the Na'vi, he was born of humans, he is human. In the eyes of the humans, he is Na'vi. The planet (people included), the only place he knows and loves, hates him because of that. He says that the animals attack him. And yet he is arguably more Na'vi than Jake. He wants to be normal, but can't.  
Kiri is loved by the planet, but not the Na'vi people, despite being basically the perfect Na'vi. Her awareness and expertise not even being recognized by both Mo'at and Ronal.  
Spider is hated by the planet, but not the humans. Who, for the first time in his life, threat him as one of their own. Despite his dad even being no longer human.  
Their parents hated each other and one even killed the other, yet they are arguably the closest non romantic (as for now) couple in the story.  
They are also both the one person who holds the greatest knowledge in their respective domain.   
They are two sides of the same coin essentially.   
At the final standoff, these two specifically are held as hostages. Both wanting the other to be unharmed the most. Eventually, after saving each other from the sinking ship, both end up saving the person that saved them. One through human means and one through Na'vi means.   
Now here is the weird part, they don't arc, not really. Both of them do not really have a character arc in the film, they end up in the exact same place they started in, once the credits roll. And yet everyone around them arcs because of them. They are the unmoving center everyone revolves around. Kiri is the main catalyst for conflict in the tribe. Her being bullied is the direct cause for Lo'ak's arc, and her having a seizure is the main reason why they are eventually found by the humans, kicking off the conflict.   
Spider of course is the catalyst for Quaritch's arc, and in turn, Neytiri's. He's also the reason for Net's death.  
Together, although indirectly, they eventually lead Jake's arc.  
They are opposites and yet fundamentally the same. They are both defective, yet highly functional. They are something that is very rare in fiction, characters with way more depth than width. Their goals are also the same.  
It is really amazing how insanely complicated these two are whilst essentially being narrative monoliths. They are the only ones who truly understand each other whilst at the same time not being able to understand each other at all.  
What the writers did here was masterfully done, and I personally can't wait to see what this dynamic will lead to.",1671403193.0

The frustration! The absolute joy on her face with every twist and turn of the story — it made my own enjoyment that much better ha ha. The bioluminescence made her say wow so loudly that a few people around us giggled.

The whole way home it was “Oh my gosh, what was YOUR favorite part Uncle Adam? MY favorite part was when he figured out how to ride the red dragon and then they went and convinced the other tribes to join them, and that one tribe on the cliff, their tribe had a girl tribe leader and she was painted red too, I liked that. My FAVORITE Character was the helicopter pilot, I loved when she painted her helicopter blue and I’m really mad that she died!”

And then the preview scenes at the end, we saw the kids swimming, so that last thing she heard before we left was Kiri’s name, so now she wants to know who Kiri is. We watched the trailer for part 2 right before I left the fam’s house and she’s pumped, hung up her poster before heading to bed asking what the dragons were called.

This is an interview that was published december 13, 2022. It was done by the most well known korean film critic.

Main points:

\- the future movies will pretty much be confined to Pandora (7:05);

\- Pandora has lots of different environments (desert, mountains, boreal forest, temperate forest, the tropical rainforest of the first movie, the polar region);

\- the movies will show how those na'vi cultures are different based on the environment they live in;

\- the movies will take the audience to ""places that are hard to describe and for sure they are very hard to do"". ""These places will have amazing imagery"";

&#x200B;

\- the state of the future movies is as such (8:08): Avatar 3 - the capture and photography (and editing) is finished, it's in post-production. Avatar 4 - completely written, completely designed, part of it is shot. Avatar 5 - ""we have a very good script, and it's completely designed"".  They can release each movie in a span of 2-3 years;

https://preview.redd.it/yzxxb3ttzrba1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=12777b5eb2612dcb54dbc6f4f1f85f0f4faef348

&#x200B;

\- he implies that Jake or Neytiri will not die in the future movies as some have theorized (14:51): the future movies will not be ""about handing off the baton to the young people. It's about seeing the entire family going forward through all of the crisis, through the war with the RDA and the humans that are trying to crush out the navis and colonize the planet. So, it's always the story of Jake and Neytiri, of Lo'ak, and the reef kids"";

\- in the above statement, he seems to imply we'll gonna have an all-out war with the RDA, not just some local incident;

\- ""kiri becomes a very important character going forward"" (15:21);

\- ""all the characters are set in motion by this movie (A2) and it continues right through 3, through 4 and through 5"". There are a lot of changes to the characters;

\- (regarding the characters) he likes to think that the filmmaker will show to the audience lots of things that people don't expect, but will feel good about;

\- they're gonna show a lot of the challenges that the characters face, and how they have to work together;

https://preview.redd.it/cteziiex0sba1.jpg?width=5000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=853c36a0b3395ba36ad9a363e5ca665808d654ee

\- the movies will show the conflicts between them that threaten to tear the family apart;

\- the story is very dramatic as it goes forward;

https://preview.redd.it/hbwsf0zb1sba1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=02b6142885bab1e751141724eab06674f7745083

&#x200B;

\- ""we promise more beauty, more wonder, more amazing creatures, but we also promise that these characters will go forward (15:58): Jake, Neytiri, Quaritch, Kiri, Lo'ak, Payakan, Spider"";

\- ""Spider becomes a very important character as well, because he is kind of the pivot point in between Quaritch and Jake"";

\- ""We can't have Quaritch and Jake constantly just fighting as we go along"". Their relationship gets much more complicated;

\- he implies that all the main characters will get more complex (16:33), and that their lives will develop overtime;

\- (16:42) ""these movies will not be like a superhero story, where there's a new villain with every film"". \[We'll gonna have\] same guy, same adversary throughout the whole thing. \[Regarding the villain, the movies\] will focus on how the villain evolves, plus we will bring in additional adversaries and allies as we go along"";

There is another interview with Cameron where he says that ""Avatar 2 is just a tease"", and that the story will take off in the next movies.

How would Aonung and Spider interact?,280,15aeso7,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15aeso7,31,"We talked about how Rotxo and Tsireya would interact with Spider, both would be super kind to him and would be more than welcome to him. Now let's talk about the seal in the room.

 We all know Aonung treated the Sully kids poorly when they first arrived (minus Tuk). He called Kiri a freak along with his friends, Left Lo'ak in the middle of the ocean, and often made fun of their appearance. All this changes when Lo'ak came upon Payakan when he got closer to the kids. Seeing Kiri in action, getting chased by humans, and being there for Neteyam's funeral. 

It would be intreating to see Aonung's reaction to seeing Spider for the first time, considering this is his first time seeing a human up close. I'm assuming the kids told him about him so he has some idea of what Spider meant to kids.

Here's my theory:

 I have a feeling he's going to be iffy about him at first. But then he's seen Spider doing all of these tasks in the clan. Then Aonung's friends come to tease Spider about his looks and being a human. However, Aonung comes to his defense.

Is Quartich going to be more na'vi than human one day?,270,1adhvx0,Avatar,https://i.redd.it/4caxlnzyx9fc1.jpeg,44,"I feel like now that Miles Quaritch is a na'vi, if he is stuck as a na'vi maybe he will turn sides (gradually of course), becoming a morally gray character, like Jake Sully, seeing that Jake after months of being in Pandora, he changed into support of the na'vi. Maybe a couple movies, or so, Quartich, will learn slowly (unwillingly) how to bond with Ewya as a Na'vi (forcibly) because well, he is stuck there in Pandora forever. Maybe his son will be a.. guiding light?  (Now ain't that cheesy)

 I'm just wondering what you think?

Okay now with neytiri and spider people keep talking about how neytiri is being unfair because Jake was a human just like spider so she has no reason to not like him but I don't think people remember that in the first movie once neytiri found out he was a traitor she left him to die and the only reason Jake is alive is being mo'at set him and grace free the only reason Jake gained neytiris trust back was because he proved himself and fought the war with them and is the sole reason that they didn't go extinct now spider hasn't proved himself to be one of the people and especially with who his father is neytiri has all right to not trust him but idk this is just how I personally feel.,1691370949.0

So often when movies have a character be adopted, there is conflict around ""who are my parents"", or when it gets revealed, ""you killed my father"".

There was none of that in Way of the water. Spider knows who his dad was and who killed him. Kiri knows she's adopted and it's not like they're keeping the information about her father from her, they most likely just don't know. Even the Sully kids know that Jake was human, and there was no ""you used to be one of our enemies"" feeling of betrayal.

It was a breath of fresh air and I want it to be appreciated.",1672707161.0

I think Tsu'tey went with her, and hen they ran to the school house, both Sylwanin and Tsu'tey were shot. 
Well Tsu'tey was nicked, on his ear.
He could've been saved by Kìreysì (Grace). I believe so because of how he reacts to Kìreysì returning to the Omatikaya in Tsu'tey's Path. He isn't angry and full of hate towards her but nervousness and he really seems to look up to and adore her though his hatred for sawtute (humans) and ayuniltìrantokx (Avatars) still stand.

Yes, that's a lot of Tsu'tey pictures, I just said I miss him.
