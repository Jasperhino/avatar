So why dont we change that? I feel theres so many amazing people in this community, who share the love of Avatar, who dream of living the Na’vi way of life.

"Avatar 3, 4 and 5: A ton of information revealed by James Cameron himself",287,10aq1p5,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/10aq1p5/avatar_3_4_and_5_a_ton_of_information_revealed_by/,69,"[https://youtube.com/watch?v=-NGO3hBkwZw](https://youtube.com/watch?v=-NGO3hBkwZw)

This is an interview that was published december 13, 2022. It was done by the most well known korean film critic.

Main points:

\- the future movies will pretty much be confined to Pandora (7:05);

\- Pandora has lots of different environments (desert, mountains, boreal forest, temperate forest, the tropical rainforest of the first movie, the polar region);

\- the movies will show how those na'vi cultures are different based on the environment they live in;

\- the movies will take the audience to ""places that are hard to describe and for sure they are very hard to do"". ""These places will have amazing imagery"";

&#x200B;

\- the state of the future movies is as such (8:08): Avatar 3 - the capture and photography (and editing) is finished, it's in post-production. Avatar 4 - completely written, completely designed, part of it is shot. Avatar 5 - ""we have a very good script, and it's completely designed"".  They can release each movie in a span of 2-3 years;

https://preview.redd.it/yzxxb3ttzrba1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=12777b5eb2612dcb54dbc6f4f1f85f0f4faef348

&#x200B;

\- he implies that Jake or Neytiri will not die in the future movies as some have theorized (14:51): the future movies will not be ""about handing off the baton to the young people. It's about seeing the entire family going forward through all of the crisis, through the war with the RDA and the humans that are trying to crush out the navis and colonize the planet. So, it's always the story of Jake and Neytiri, of Lo'ak, and the reef kids"";

\- in the above statement, he seems to imply we'll gonna have an all-out war with the RDA, not just some local incident;

\- ""kiri becomes a very important character going forward"" (15:21);

\- ""all the characters are set in motion by this movie (A2) and it continues right through 3, through 4 and through 5"". There are a lot of changes to the characters;

\- (regarding the characters) he likes to think that the filmmaker will show to the audience lots of things that people don't expect, but will feel good about;

\- they're gonna show a lot of the challenges that the characters face, and how they have to work together;

https://preview.redd.it/cteziiex0sba1.jpg?width=5000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=853c36a0b3395ba36ad9a363e5ca665808d654ee

\- the movies will show the conflicts between them that threaten to tear the family apart;

\- the story is very dramatic as it goes forward;

https://preview.redd.it/hbwsf0zb1sba1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=02b6142885bab1e751141724eab06674f7745083

&#x200B;

\- ""we promise more beauty, more wonder, more amazing creatures, but we also promise that these characters will go forward (15:58): Jake, Neytiri, Quaritch, Kiri, Lo'ak, Payakan, Spider"";

\- ""Spider becomes a very important character as well, because he is kind of the pivot point in between Quaritch and Jake"";

\- ""We can't have Quaritch and Jake constantly just fighting as we go along"". Their relationship gets much more complicated;

\- he implies that all the main characters will get more complex (16:33), and that their lives will develop overtime;

\- (16:42) ""these movies will not be like a superhero story, where there's a new villain with every film"". \[We'll gonna have\] same guy, same adversary throughout the whole thing. \[Regarding the villain, the movies\] will focus on how the villain evolves, plus we will bring in additional adversaries and allies as we go along"";

There is another interview with Cameron where he says that ""Avatar 2 is just a tease"", and that the story will take off in the next movies.

How would Aonung and Spider interact?,278,15aeso7,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15aeso7,31,"We talked about how Rotxo and Tsireya would interact with Spider, both would be super kind to him and would be more than welcome to him. Now let's talk about the seal in the room.

 We all know Aonung treated the Sully kids poorly when they first arrived (minus Tuk). He called Kiri a freak along with his friends, Left Lo'ak in the middle of the ocean, and often made fun of their appearance. All this changes when Lo'ak came upon Payakan when he got closer to the kids. Seeing Kiri in action, getting chased by humans, and being there for Neteyam's funeral. 

It would be intreating to see Aonung's reaction to seeing Spider for the first time, considering this is his first time seeing a human up close. I'm assuming the kids told him about him so he has some idea of what Spider meant to kids.

Here's my theory:

 I have a feeling he's going to be iffy about him at first. But then he's seen Spider doing all of these tasks in the clan. Then Aonung's friends come to tease Spider about his looks and being a human. However, Aonung comes to his defense.

Is Quartich going to be more na'vi than human one day?,269,1adhvx0,Avatar,https://i.redd.it/4caxlnzyx9fc1.jpeg,44,"I feel like now that Miles Quaritch is a na'vi, if he is stuck as a na'vi maybe he will turn sides (gradually of course), becoming a morally gray character, like Jake Sully, seeing that Jake after months of being in Pandora, he changed into support of the na'vi. Maybe a couple movies, or so, Quartich, will learn slowly (unwillingly) how to bond with Ewya as a Na'vi (forcibly) because well, he is stuck there in Pandora forever. Maybe his son will be a.. guiding light?  (Now ain't that cheesy)

Neteyam - The firstborn child,147,102zpum,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/102zpum/neteyam_the_firstborn_child/,24,"Neteyam is the firstborn between a genuine Na'vi and an avatar, so his position in the family as well as his race is extremely important. Many friends say that it is difficult to distinguish between the two brothers, in fact, Neteyam's face always exudes a strong and gentle look and he rarely has showoff actions like his brother Lo'ak. Simply put, whoever wears more elaborate jewelry, that guy is Neteyam.

Because 3 hours is quite long and difficult to distinguish, people can feel that his shoulders are not outstanding. But if you look closely, Neteyam has a lot of memorable moments and if he lacks, it's because he doesn't show off much.

As the oldest child, Neteyam is expected by many parents. You can see the scene where Neteyam was directly taught archery and combat by his father. Neteyam was expected to lead and protect the children, and he did just that. It can be said that Neteyam is a perfect leader when he does everything carefully, not putting his family in danger.

Neteyam also carries the responsibility of a guardian. Neteyam carried baby Tuk instead of his father. Neteyam saved Kiri when she fainted in the sea. Neteyam ran into the sea of ​​fire to save his brother. Neteyam does everything very hard, is tenacious, and never holds a grudge.

Neteyam is also a good brother when taking care of and understanding the children. In the movie, I only see Neteyam being scolded by his father and scolded by his younger brother, but rarely see Neteyam being harsh on anyone. However, Neteyam is also extremely brave and acts like a big brother when the children are bullied. If Lo'ak is like a young child jumping out to demand a decisive battle, but the opponent is not necessarily afraid, Neteyam only needs to be serious, say a few words, and the opponent has to respect. It can be said that Neteyam is the most well-educated and perfect child in Sully's family, he can take over the position of leader of his father at any time.

Even so, in the end, Neteyam was just a 15-year-old kid. Neteyam never complained or showed any discomfort when he had to move to the seaside village, but before he died, he just said ""Dad, I want to go home"":((((((( I don't know you guys) How you feel, but I think the character build of the movie is very good and delicate. When hit by bullets, Neteyam tried to swim out, saw that the children were fine, then said that he was injured. , Neteyam said in pain, ""Sir, I'm sorry"" showing the sense of responsibility and discipline that she was trained in, but in the end, the nature of a child still revealed.

Although only appears in one part of the movie, it can be said that the character Neteyam has been built quite completely. His departure will be the driving force for the other members of Sully's family to change and bond even more.

(That said, at the end of the funeral, Neteyam and his parents went to the tree of life to see him again when he was young, I couldn't hold back my tears (the first child was the one who stayed with his parents the longest and was also expected by his parents) best) should not have to describe how heartbroken Neteyam's parents were)",1672826443.0
James Cameron is like... super normal. The hate he gets is unfair.,145,zxjhwa,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zxjhwa/james_cameron_is_like_super_normal_the_hate_he/,46,"Long time listener first time caller. Love this franchise always have. Saw the new movie 5x already. More viewings planned. 

Anyway. So something I find exceedingly disturbing throughout society is its desire to attempt to tear down or smear successful people. I infer its just society's miserable insecurity with itself as a whole. ""Society"" of course meaning just... people.

But so. Entertainment media has done WORK to try to portay James Cameron is this arrogant, egotistical asshole. But I gotta say. I've seen enough interviews of him, commentary on all of his movies, etc. to say that he strikes me as an authentic, genuine, funny, and exceedingly normal man with immense talent for filmmaking, a penchant for storytelling in both speaking and in his movies, and unfaltering care for our natural world and the diverse humanity in it.

I just... whenever I see a headline run about James Cameron, particularly with Avatar, when I actually seek out the context it turns out, expectedly, that he presents his thoughts with care. Care that is so offensively reduced by a grabby drama-y headline or one off quite in some news tabloid level article. That then of course idiots who don't actually read the article or seek the fuller context will hold onto that view forever. But do you ever hear how his actors and creatives speak about him? Very fondly. I agree that he strikes me as having been a very intense early career perfectionist, and he has certainly mellowed out in his old age, but that's a *good* thing. People can change for the better.

I don't know. Maybe me defending this obscenely rich, successful white man is a little cringe. He doesn't need my help and I get nothing in return for this. But I feel like... there are many worse creatives far more deserving of the hate he gets. His interviews make me smile and I admire his talent and his movies are my favorites. For context, I'm a 28 year old Black and Latina woman <-- I say this because I do think it relevant to combat the visual of the type of people praising such a person like James Cameron.

It could be argued that his mother had an influence to stay away from him over time, and he did. In the comics, Spider leaves out Neteyam's name when he lists the ""family"" he has left when arguing with Neytiri. In the movie, Lo'ak asked Neteyam to help him recuse Spider from the ship; he did an annoyed growl at the idea but decided to go and save him.

Spider cries as Neteyam dies from his bullet wound and cries as he become one with Ewya.

Are people actually THAT dumb or am I just going crazy? (An essay in defense of Spider),131,10gcv48,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/10gcv48/are_people_actually_that_dumb_or_am_i_just_going/,45,"I'm sorry, but those are the only two possible explanations. I'm either going completely insane or folks are really fucking kidding me, because I just can't believe how oblivious some people can be.

When I walked out of the theater after watching the movie for the first time, I was reflecting on the characters and I thought that Spider would become one of the most well received characters by the public, and I was almost shocked when I found out that he was being hated on by everyone on twitter and tiktok, some people even saying that he should've died instead of Neteyam or that Neytiri should have killed him in the worst way possible. And after going through a limbo of comments and even videos from people slandering Spider, I was able to come to the conclusion that the majority of people who are hating on his character either:

A) Weren't paying attention to what they were watching.

or

B) Are unfamiliar with the term ""gray morality"" when it comes to character writing.

Much of the A option's evidence comes from people who say that ""Spider was a traitor"", and when you ask them why, their answer usually is ""Because he chose Quaritch over the family who raised him"". First off, Spider didn't ""chose"" anyone, because he was fucking kidnapped, he wasn't even in the position of someone able to make a choice. Second, he wasn't raised by the Sullies, he had a human foster human family who raised him, he was just fascinated by the family and started following them around. Jake himself says in the beginning of the movie that Spider wasn't part of their family, that he was like a stray cat always around his kids. Having all of this in context, Spider was basically the kid next door, for Jake, he was the equivalent of a neighbor's kid that he finds annoying but let him play with his kids anyway because they like him, and Neytiri... well, I don't even have to say anything about her feelings towards Spider, do I? Also, how can people say that Spider chose Quaritch when in the end, he hissed at him and joined back with the Sullies? I saw some idiot on youtube saying that he was constantly changing sides and that it was his decision to stick with the squad of recombs, and that's so not true, I wonder if some of these people are deliberately lying? Quaritch made it clear that it was no use for Spider to try running away because he had put a tracker on him, he also tried to escape in the ship scene and was easily contained by the RDA guys again. That's not even mentioning the scene where knocks some dude out with a fire extinguisher and fucks up the motor of the ship. He was most definitely *not* constantly changing sides, his loyalty always stayed with the Sullies and he resisted greatly, he didn't say anything about the Omaticaya even under a torture session, the kid is like, the biggest Jake Sully fanboy out there. Other stupid argument some people use to hate on him is that ""He should've done something"", referring to that scene where Quaritch and his gang burn down a Na'vi village. Like, what these mfs expected him to do? Punch one of the recoms and go ""John Wick"" mode on them? He's one teenager against (5, I guess?) Avatars and some other heavily armed soldiers in exosuits. It was actually thanks to his crying and begging for them to not kill anyone that they decided to *only* burn the village, cause Quaritch was threatening to kill the clan's tsahik, people should be glad that Spider *was* there to calm his tits down.

On the case of option B, it basically comes from people bitching over his decision to save Quaritch's life at the end of the movie. In the story, months passed from the time Spider was kidnapped until the end of the film, which means that he and Quaritch spent a lot of time together. It is also worth remembering that the Recom Quaritch and the human Quaritch who died in the first film are *not* the same person, and this was made clear in the film. Now, put yourself in Spider's shoes, you're an orphaned teenager who's only been told stories about your biological father's bad side all your life, feeling like you don't fit in growing up, until you actually meet your father and he shows it again and again that he cares about you (despite saying he doesn't), unlike the people you've looked up to your whole life. I mean, the only ones in the Sully family who actually care about him are Kiri and Lo'ak, the rest didn't really gave a single shit about him, unlike most people think, he wasn't adopted by the family until maybe the end of the movie - seriously, their reaction when he was kidnapped by Quaritch was basically ""Oh, they took Spider. Let's just move out before he gives up any information."" and not ""OMG, our son! We must rescue him!"". Anyway, what I'm trying to say here is that Spider and Quaritch grew a bond after spending so much time together. Spider's final decision in saving him may have been a bad one since he heard when Quaritch said he wouldn't stop until Jake was dead, but it shows that Spider have a moral compass, Neytiri almost killed him and it was thanks to Quaritch that she didn't, he saved his life basically as an act of gratitude, and also probably to have his conscience clear for not letting his own father die, not because he now loves him or because he is now on his side, otherwise he wouldn't have reunited with the Sullies again. It was Quaritch who demonstrated multiple times that he cared about him while the Sullies didn't even *tried* to rescue him when he was kidnapped. He had all these conflicting feelings inside him when he made this decision, and that's why it's a morally gray decision, and it only adds depth to his character, but instead, some people are taking it as if what he did was an irredeemable act of villainy. And I also noticed that some of the people who are doing this are the same who used to complain that ""Avatar characters are shallow and one-dimensional""... ugh, you can't never win with these people. Do you want complex characters or not? Make up your goddamn minds!

Spider was a great character and seeing so many people reducing him just as ""the kid who saved the bad guy = shitty character"" honestly makes me sad when he had so many positive qualities as a character. He was fun, witty, brave, loyal, determined, defiant, had a sweet nature, had this instinct to protect his loved ones, he could be quite mature for his age, but also had some childish moments. And he was overall a pretty good person and a very human character (no puns intended).

But anyway, apologies if I came across as slightly bitter in this post, but I loved Spider and I can't wait to see more of his development in the sequels. I wish more people would appreciate his character and see that he is more relatable and has more layers than you can think at first glance.",1674161483.0
I just watched Avatar for the first time and I'm in love.,129,xqk7jh,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/xqk7jh/i_just_watched_avatar_for_the_first_time_and_im/,45,"This may be repetitive around here, but idk, I feel like I have to say this somewhere.  
While the plot isn't all that ~~original~~ (a better word is something like ""revolutionary"" or ""ground-breaking"", as discussed with robust_syrup in comments), I'm still absolutely in love with the movie - the characters, the acting, and the beautiful CGI - it's all just stunning. I just don't know what to say. This is the best movie I've ever seen, this is a masterpiece, I'm already hyped for TWoW. I simply love how Avatar just has a good idea and proceeds to develop it to its potential. The Na'vi seem very thought out (interesting culture, a whole language developed just for the movie, plus I really like the idea of Tsaheylu) The ending feels complete while leaving a window for sequels. Just, every aspect of this movie that I can think of is perfect. I just want more, I want to see more of Pandora, more of the Na'vi, more of the pretty VFX, it's all surreal to me. No movie has ever made me feel the way Avatar just did, and I love it. This one caused some changes on my best movie list, that's for sure.

I genuinely believe that Avatar fans are the strongest/toughest fans in the world. The amount of RUBBISH we have to deal with in terms of people hating on the films, games and characters is insane. 

I just wanted to say that I am so happy to see other people like myself on this page/around the world who enjoy the world of Pandora as much as I do. I really love ya'll. 

A lot of people in the general audience don't understand the meaning of these films, and they sh\*t on it in so many ways it doesn't deserve. These movies changed cinema with just 2 installments. 2. 

The Na'vi and their home are the ideal dream world we should be living in, also in harmony with nature. For those who appreciate this aspect of the franchise, you are doing the right thing.

I will forever love Avatar, considering it was something my late grandmother and I bonded over, and Kiri is a massive comfort character for me. On Christmas Day I'll finally be able to play Frontiers, and no more will I listen to the criticism this franchise gets. 

Call me cringe, but I just had to get this off my chest.

A message to all PADS sufferers,131,1034g0i,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/1034g0i/a_message_to_all_pads_sufferers/,7,"I’ve seen many people on here with the Avatar blues (or PADS) claiming earth is just gray and boring, that the world we live in is dull compared to pandora etc. And after seeing this a few times, I felt the need to adress it.

I created the subforum r/pandoraonearth to remind people that Earth is Pandora. Because I feel many, even Avatar fans, tend to forget this. The indigenous people, the communicative network of the trees, the bioluminescent creatures, the sentient species, the deep connections between humans and other species, the symbiosis between species, the cooperation to preserve balance, the intellgience they posess, the superpowers (bioluminescense, camoflauge, ability to grow back limbs, using the moon and stars as compasses, go back to polyp structures, neutralize toxins, convert from liquid to solid forms, masters at imitations, regenerate organs, super visions and so much more). 

All of these things is what make earth the most intelligent, the most powerful place in the universe. Nothing will ever compare to the forces of mother earth. No matter how much power humans think they have over nature, that they can rule like gods of the world, will ever change this. The fact that dinosaurs or mammoths walked this earth before us, or evolution has been taking place for 4 billion years - is proof of this.

Humans can wound the planet, leave scars as big as lost ecosystems and extinct species. But what they are doing is hurting themselves in the process, letting the demon kill all that humans truly 
are.  
But we dont have to let that happen to ourselves. We dont have to forget our place on this earth, and our true purpose. We are part of nature and she is part of us. So let the earth carry you in her heart again. Let her be proud of who you are and what you can do. Because she calls for you, and that calling lives in each one of us - no matter how much we try to look the other way.

She calls for your protection. So dont shun that voice inside of you, listen to it. Listen to the human inside and make the radical changes you need to be her ally. Because we are at war with nature, and its up to you to pick a side. Learn how to become the warrior you were meant to be.",1672841055.0
Remember this set Photo popped up during ATWOW?,132,150hlv7,Avatar,https://i.redd.it/n8m2eougx5cb1.jpg,20,"After everything that came out about three so far, I went back to this set picture that came out before and during ATWOW.

Making the gusse this part will happen in three. But the whole leak about >!Spider gaining the ability to breath the air, thanks to Kiri!< The way I see photo now, changes a bit. 

So here my theory what's happening here and this could be completely wrong. 

>!Norm doing a check-up on Spider after magically breathing the air, hinting why Norm is wearing his mask. This part may or may not offer us an answer for Spider's change after running some tests on him!< Or this could be a deleted sense altogether.

"The whole Sully family went into survival mode, and the depth of this scene kills me every time.",125,172vso6,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/172vso6,5,"this scene always leaves me speechless. The way that tuk was not crying like we would expect someone her age to do, she was upset, and i believe that in this fight, she went on a sort of autopilot, She saw someone get shot right infront of her, instead of being shocked, she was relieved that it was her mama who killed that person. I feel like that truly changed something inside her, at the first rescue mission she simply cried, and now she was more than ready to fight back.

One thing that is also incredibly interesting, is how kiris german dub, refers to quaritch as „Sie“ („Sie kommen und holen sie“ = „that’s right, they‘re comin for u!“)

„Sie“ is a form of respect, its how we refer to authorities/ older people in german, so even though they were kidnapped, she still „respected“ him. up to the point where he held that knife against her neck. 

And then of course the way that Tuk was so focused on Kiri surviving , it had me speechless, she didnt cry, she just kept repeating „Kiri“ , i also believe that her brain partially blurred out the part where neytiri first grabbed spider, it was just afterwards, when they got into the water that tuk realized what had actually happened „Mama.. come please..Mama!“ a 7-8 year old, was so afraid for her mama, this was most likely the part where she was just in full on survival mode. When she then fell into the ship, she does what neytiri tells her, and even though they couldnt find a way out, they were totally lost in the darkness, tuk STILL stayed calm which is insane to me. 

A little girl like her, went from crying the moment she got captured, to surviving kidnapping, and nearly drowning. Even during neteyams funeral, her last look to him was full of sadness and admiration, it makes me sad how she is all alone swimming there though.

I feel like tuk is going to have a sort of emotional instability after all this. Perhaps she will ultimately be the one to kill Quaritch.",1696760544.0

He sympathised with the indigenous, whom Quaritch literally tried to genocide. *”We will blast a hole so deep in their racial memory that they won’t ever come within a thousand clicks of here ever again”*

He fought back against a military industrial complex that was not only his species, but his brothers in arms. Jake was a marine. A warrior. The uniformed services often have very close relationships (probably some form of trauma bonding, especially with active duty??). And Quaritch literally PROMISED and had SUCCEEDED in getting Jakes human legs back.

But he didn’t want them. Because he was more happy and fulfilled and alive as a Na’vi than he could ever be on earth. His twin brother was dead, and there was no mention of his parents, so I assume they’re not in the picture. His change is really shown when the Dozers destroy the Tree of Voices where him and Neytiri mate for life. 

He smashed the camera. Without hesitation. He knew they were coming at some point, but he still chose to attack them and blind one. He also bares his fangs as he’s doing so, another Na’vi trait. In the background of Neytiri crying, we also see Jake hit the tree he’s near, possibly out of pure frustration and rage.

So no, it’s not just *Dances with Wolves in space* with some white saviour thrown in.

People re-watching the first Avatar movie and suddenly liking it so much more than in 2009 is more than just hopping on a trend,110,up5455,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/up5455/people_rewatching_the_first_avatar_movie_and/,24,"I've seen a lot of comments here about how people seem to have suddenly started liking the first movie after the trailer of Way of the Water. There's a lot of making fun of how quickly people seemed to switch from ""We decided to collectively forget about Avatar"" to ""Weeeeeeeeee ! The sequel has a trailer !"".  


I think there's more to it than that.  


The main critic that people had about the first movie was that it had a predictable, unoriginal classical white savior story. And I think we mostly agree on the predictable part, and I think the white savior story part is quite fair too (though there is some nuance to bring to that, and u/tallovision talked about that much better than I could here [https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/uoa0jk/comment/i8ddziq/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/uoa0jk/comment/i8ddziq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).)  


But if Avatar is indeed all that, it is far from *just* being that. Avatar is also the story of a disabled person escaping a situation where he is alone and stuck, from a planet where nature has been destroyed, to a moon that is colourful and full of life.   
He witnesses the nature of this planet, takes the time to learn about another culture directly from the people of this culture.   
He gets to walk and run again, then fly, he joins with a tribe and fights a monopoly corporation's mercenaries alongside them,  
He learns to know and love about Pandora and it's culture.  


Avatar isn't just a white savior story.  
It's an anticapitalistic story,   
It's an ecologist story, and to some extent, a naturalist one.  
More than that,  
It's a story about escaping helplessness and a toxic environment, about regaining agency,  
It's a story about finding (financial) safety (by getting rid of the financial part altogether),  
It's a story about connecting with nature, and literally, with the animals in it,  
It's a story about finding love, community, about belonging,  
And in a classical hero way, it's a story about becoming the best version of oneself.  


Long story short, it's a story about fulfilling our basic needs.  


I'd be willing to bet that a lot of us who have been fans for a longer time, have become so at a time where we also felt stuck in a situation where our basic needs were not fulfilled. At the time, Avatar allowed us to temporarily escape and fulfil our needs by empathy with the characters. Maybe also find hope for ourselves in the process, and community in the fandom.  


In 2009, most people had coping mechanisms that let them mostly fulfil their needs. When they watched Avatar, they only saw the white savior story, and probably the anticapitalistic and ecologist one.  


Now, we're in 2022. We had 3 years of a pandemic that forced us to stay in our homes, distance ourselves form each other, and in one way or another made us feel less safe. The USA have been increasingly polarized, there is war in Europe, I hear unfun things are happening in Asia too, and the IPCC is like ""WTF y'all, we really need to act about climate change *now* !"".  
Lots of coping mechanisms have become difficult to continue, and basic needs have been much harder to fulfil.  


So now, so many people who re-watch the first movie see what we saw in 2009. Not because of a jumping into a trend, but because Avatar, for most people, is just that much more relevant in this decency than it was to the last two ones.",1652487184.0
I have a theory. About this scene,106,1586cac,Avatar,https://i.redd.it/rtxsdg5a0wdb1.jpg,11,"That in this scene when she tells Tsyeyk, ""I will not stand and do nothing"", she is actually speaking English. Both of them are. Throughout the film when she has been speaking Na'vi (translated for us), it has been clear and straightforward. But when she has spoke English it's a bit clunky. She doesn't shorten words e.g. ""I will kill you as many times as I have to"" not ""I'll"", she does the same here with ""I will not"" instead of ""I won't"". 

It also explains why Tsyeyk and Neytiri are able to have their conversion in a public area without causing upset.

It could also explain why Neytiri calls him ""Tsyeyk"" instead of MaTsyeyk. I think it's cause she was angry but a change change in language as she is getting better at it, could be the reason.",1690193241.0

Awareness of how we talk about Na’vi society.,104,17lo0vv,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/17lo0vv/awareness_of_how_we_talk_about_navi_society/,57,"Let me first say, I’m not trying to spark fandom discourse, nor is this the majority of people here. It’s just something I see every now and then. I doubt people mean anything malicious either, just mistakes and lack of knowledge. I still believe someone should say it though.

I should also note that I’m not Indigenous. I’m so white that I have pumpkin spice in my veins instead of blood. I’m just repeating what I’ve heard from Indigenous peoples and my knowledge on human history.

I’ve noticed that some people when talking about Na’vi society will use outdated/inaccurate terms, and have a misconception of not only how these societies work, but also human history in general.

Saying things like “Less civilized” or “Why are they so primitive? They should advance” is missing the point but also not a good way of thinking. 

First off, calling Indigenous societies less civilized is just plain racist. The idea that western cultures are more “civilized” and “advanced” is a product of colonialism and the idea that we must change the ways of others. 

As for “Why are they not advanced, wouldn’t it make life better?” (Ignoring the laws of Eywa for this one since lots don’t know it)

Let me tell you a rule of life: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.

For the vast majority of human history we were all hunter-gatherers. Farming is a VERY recent invention that popped up independently in different parts of the world. However, many societies didn’t turn to farming. One of the reasons historians and anthropologists find it interesting is because we still aren’t entirely sure why we invented farming because hunting and gathering worked so well. 

People don’t stop being hunter-gatherers because they existed for a long time. If that was the case, then every society would’ve turned to farming. 

The question isn’t “why are hunter-gatherer societies not advanced?” But rather “why did we stop being hunter-gatherers?” 

Studies have shown that these societies (taking out the hardships that colonialism brought upon them) are often healthier than farming societies.

The reason I bring up farming so much is because that’s what paved way for our society to end up the way it did.

Another thing I think people need to keep in mind is cultural relativity. Why would we deem Na’vi society as lesser when they have a completely different culture, lifestyle, and environment than us? 

The Na’vi would NOT be better off with our lifestyle and tech, they don’t need it and have never needed it. Acting as though they would fair better if they changed their ways is the exact ideology that Europeans had when trying to “fix” other cultures…which is literally just ethnocide. 

The other thing I’ve been seeing, is people who seem to sugarcoat the RDA and Na’vi conflict. I keep seeing people act like the Na’vi are somehow not giving the humans a chance or that they should share their home. 

To that I say, rewatch the movies. Yes, humans need a new home, but the RDA is more concerned about fancy metals and whale goo for rich people. It’s literally just a full blown invasion. They do not care about humans, if anything they’re using it as a front. The Na’vi have EVERY right to want them gone. There’s no “compromise” outside of humans leaving. 

There is no such thing as “good” invaders.",1698877329.0
Concept Idea for new Gamemode: Operation Homestead,104,18vyfp9,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18vyfp9,96,"My friend and I who are RDA fans were talking about some ideas for a mode in which you can play as as the RDA kind of it would be more like a strategy/conquest type mode instead of a fully fledged campaign which would take a heck of a lot longer.

The ""Plot"":
You take on the role of an RDA ""Regional Colonization Director"" who's arrived to the planet (or some other facy title) point is your Task is to gather resources to both sustain your colonies or forts/outposts and stuff to sell back to the RDA for profit and off world resources and of course to expand humanity's reach into pandora. You will also have advisors who will help you in the pursuit of that goal whether through peaceful means or force of hand you must complete your mission and meet profit quotas set by the RDA or your colonies and forts/outpost will be considered a lost caused and abandoned.

Advisors:
The RDA Representative.
This Advisors Job is to make sure you are meeting profit quotas for the RDA as well as in charge or off world resource allocation like building materials, civilian colonists/laborers, food preserves, machinery, and equipment They will also assist you in figuring out what resources are needed the most per year/month/season and where to possibly locate them as well as assisting you with budgeting and giving you Tasks from RDA HQ.

The SecOps Commander.
This Advisors Job is to make sure the peace is kept in your colonies and or forts/outposts and with the local native population. They will also assist you with the production of on world Security Forces (Colonial Militia & Soldiers) they will also have the added bonus of assisting you with allocating off world military resources such as AMP suits, Helicopters, Military Vehicles, and importing Veteran RDA Soldiers. They will also provide you with advice on protecting your trade/supply routes and how to defend against/attack the Native Tribes.

The Science Department Head/Lead.
This Advisors Job is to assist you with the more scientific aspects of running your colony efforts and with building a relationship with local Tribes. The will help you with research and development with on world assets such as finding a way to make padoran soild fertile for earth food, understanding the ecosystem of the region and were the most dangerous predators are and where they migrate to, and assisting you with local relations with the Tribes. They will advise you on how to build a friendly relationship with local Na'vi leaders and assist with the diplomatic aspects of that relationship like brokering a deal for mining resources and expansion. As well as assisting you with making use of the Avatar Program which will allow you to scout out local areas and send diplomatic missions to villages.

The Colonial Management Lead.
This Advisors Job is to help you with the more administrative side to your mission they will tell you how your colonists feel about the Natives and local area, what the needs and wants of each colony/fort/outpost are, providing Stat for population, and management of trade/supply routes are (separate from their protection) as well as the development of infrastructure such as building types and route management (I.E how your colonies trade with each other be it via air, train or car) like real colonization civilians and workers are the vast majority of your population and this Advisors will help you manage their well being and give you advice on general Colonial development and how to best spread out your civilians across Job types.

Gameplay Mechanics:

Civilians (population)
They will be the very backbone of your mission on pandora with your Civilians kept happy they will produce more.....colonists and will allow you to speed up production of resources by allocating more Civilians to a mining project and military/security forces recruitment. They are just as if not more so important that the resources you mine from the planet as if you lose civilians (via war, raids, insurrection, and abandonment) your mission will become harder as you will gather resources much slower and might not have the ability to defend your colonies/forts/outposts. They also keep your colonies running by working jobs in that colony (power production, repairing building/stations and equipment, producing more colonists and working the menial jobs like Cook and janitor)

SecOps (Defense/Offense)
Your security forces are incharge of defending you civilians and keeping the peace along with expansion of your efforts. They will be the backbone the defense of your colonies/forts/outposts and trade/supply routes without them your civilians may be killed by local Natives or wildlife of pandora same rule applies for trade routes even the very animals of pandora will be against you. Unlike other resources they are not as large as your civilians population and just like your civilian population they can die off I wars/raids not just that but you can lose the assets they employ as well such as AMP suits, Helicopters, Vehicles. If you lose enough of them along with their assets it will become very hard/impossible to not just make war but defend your colonies/forts/outposts. As mentioned before they will also play an offensive role as well which depending on what it is you will be able to play in the situations your forces will be able to conduct Raid, Ambush, SpecOps, and Attack missions on the Na'vi your AMP Suits, Helicopters, Vehicles will be the tip of the spear of such assaults so make sure to be strategic with them just like conventional war your ground infantry will play a supportive role in defending these assets. Let's be real here an 8 man squad of just infantryman would be destroyed by just 1 or 2 maybe 3 Na'vi so having ground and air support is an absolute need. You will be able to play in these attacks as an RDA junior officer (Random NPC Skin) you can be in an AMP Suit, Helicopter (Pilot or Gunner) or if your ballsy on foot (surrounded by A.I veteran troops always) it'll be similar to like a mount and blade type battle or Raid where your unit number and stats will have an effect on how many units will spawn when others die you will also be able to call in artillery and close Air support in if you have a Fort or Colony nearby. In general if you wish to play a more offensive campaign this will be the bread and butter of your experience.

Science Team (Research and Diplomacy)
The Science team and it's members will play the role of researching new tech for your efforts and using the Avatar Program to build and manage the relationships you have with local Tribes you'll be able to play as a random Na'vi Avatar and do little quests for the Tribes in order to better your relationship you will also be able to do little missions in a certain region to obtain a plant or item that could further your research of a specific tech.

Resources and Development (Self explanatory)
Basically this will fall under the 1st and 4th advisors area kind of expertise basically you will have to make a certain profit quota set by the RDA (which will change) in order to keep receiving their support as they will send you additional resources and you'll be able to make money from selling to the RDA which you will use to buy buildings and get off word equipment to expedite the process of resources gathering like diggers and miner machines. You must reach the Quota otherwise there will be debuffs for example if you fail to me quota depending on how bad you missed the mark off world resources will be more expensive and you will have less funds to develop your settlement of you fail to meet quota 3 more times then you the RDA will consider your effort more of a loss and therefore not worth it and you will be fired and the game mode is over.

The Locals (Na'vi Tribes/Clans)
Since you represent the RDA the locals of Pandora are let's just say not your biggest fans in fact in they either are distrustful of you or just don't want to interact with you so how do you deal with them? Divide and Conquer or Hearts and Minds the RDA over all doesn't care about them so long as they get what they need/want so it's up to you how you deal with them will be up to you completely you can go 1 of 2 paths.

Peaceful:
You can rely on more of your Science Team and listen to your Advisors in order to broker a peace with the Natives by slowly helping them and forming treaties with them so that you can peacefully mine the local areas however of course you won't yeld as many resources as you would if you just flat out conquered them but such is the cost of being a peaceful Director of course this will affect you in many ways such as stunting your population as significant expansion will cause the Tribes to be upset with you and over industrialization of your mining operations will have the same effect so your civilian workers won't have Jobs so that could cause problems in your settlements and you may have to use SecOps to suppress your own mind not only this since you won't be extracting that many resources meeting quota will be hard if not impossible sometimes. But it is possible but naturally you won't be as successful and the process won't be as quick than if you just did it the old fashioned way.

Militaristic:
You have the advantage of Technology from earth not just that but as a Mega Corporation the RDA can supply with top of the line military equipment and state of the art weapon systems so why not use them? You have the advantage of long range weaponry and you have the ability to make war where you need to and you are able to call in quick reaction forces anywhere so long as you have the means to if the Na'vi don't want to listen to reason then make them use your SecOps men to overrun and outgun the savages after all they're not like us. On a serious note if you want to always make quota and expand your efforts then you need to get your hands dirty you can approach this in different ways like brokering a peace with a tribe and mining their resources slowly then dedicate more civilans and more equipment to that operation sure this will piss off the Na'vi but if they try to attack or shun you then take what you want by force or you can outright make war with them and kill them off and wipe them from the area. There are downsides to this of course hostile actions from waring Tribes will disrupt your trade/supply routes and they will Raid your mining operations and the outskirts of your settlements and forts killing civilians and RDA SecOps patrols. Not only this but other Na'vi Tribes will be more hostile towards you and may be less prone to workwith you. Naturally the members of your Science Team may defect to the Na'vi side including any members of the Avatar Program and by doing so could supply weapons to the Na'vi making them that much harder to fight. Civilians may leave and abandon your settlements if to much death occurs and they will lose faith in your leadership this could also occur if supply routes are attack a lot and you have to chance to protect them with RDA units. However grow fast enough you maybe be able to overpower the Na'vi through numbers and tech and you can strike them before they even see it coming. You can destroy holy sites for them as well as release biological weapons in decrease their will to fight but by doing do other Tribes will not work with you at all and they may all unite against you and of course you may not survive. This route will be as challenging as the last but in a different sense it would be the exact opposite to the peaceful route in which you'll have the resources you need and the possibilities  you need to expand but you'll sacrifice that for peace. Where as on the other side you'll have peace but may lack the resources to succeed. 


Overview:
This was just some ideas I had when talking to my homeboy about how an RDA sudo campaign could be implemented as the map for this thing would be like an overview man of the world like skyrim for example and it would be like a turn base type system or a classical RTS type mode but the events of what is going would pop up like notifications similar to stalaris or like an other Paradox studio game it would of course take time to implement systems like this but I think it wouldn't be as long as making a whole new flushed out story driven campaign for the Humans plus it would really but the player in a curious position and would make the reality of colonization show not as black and white but shades of Grey on one hand yes you work for a Mega Corporation who cares only about profits but on the other you are providing Jobs and new opportunities to the average person you are furthering the development of the Human race and though while earth is dying yes you are providing people with a means to leave and come for a better though one could argue harsher life. Earth may not be able to be saved especially with our population growing each and everyday so what's a few Alien lives compared to saving thousands of Human lives after all most of you wouldn't care abt the Na'vi if they were monstrous looking aliens lol you don't play barotrauma and think hmmmm yeah the mudraptors have a point....

Conclusion:
Yeah I was just thinking this stuff up as we talked and I think it would be a cool concept Idea that would appease both sides of the field those RDA lovers (Like me) and Na'vi lovers while providing a more human perspective.",1704121321.0
We will look back on the Avatar movies in very similar ways to how we look back on the Star Wars movies now.,102,zyhm4k,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zyhm4k/we_will_look_back_on_the_avatar_movies_in_very/,35,"Not taking away from the brilliance that is Star Wars and it’s unbelievably significant impact on both cinema and culture. You objectively cannot take away from that. 

What I’m saying is the same exact way we look at Star Wars with such a reverence, for both cinema and as a cultural phenomenon, we will do the same with Avatar, in time. 

Avatar will be the Star Wars of this time in cinema and culture. 

Avatar is going to revolutionize the movie theater experience. 

We are going to see new technologies and levels of immersion that have never been experienced before. 

The Avatar movies will be a game changer for the entertainment industry. They will easily match and likely surpass the cultural impact and financial prowess that both the Star Wars and MCU Universes have accomplished. 

This *does not* take away from those outstanding, magnificent works of entertainment. 

Avatar is the next step. 

The way we define “going to the movies” or “watching a movie” is going to change, and the way that’s going to change is going to be brought to us through the Avatar movies and entertainment media. The way we relate to movies and consequently ourselves will be revolutionized by Avatar. 

This will be done primarily through technological advancements and also creative genius with thought provoking, deep, and spiritual story telling that is symbolically intwined with our reality here, both physically on earth and spiritually as soulful beings. We will find ourselves questioning reality, ourselves, our true nature, and of course our relationship with planet earth thanks to these movies. 

We will look back in awe and reverence. Avatar is just getting started.",1672350687.0

Avatar Guy is best known for his excellent videos breaking down news and details about the AVATAR franchise, especially the films. He has a love and deep knowledge of James Cameron's movies and expresses this with each discussion and breakdown he makes.

In his [Why I love James Cameron's Avatar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6UhV5HXkO0) video, Avatar Guy talks about his first time seeing AVATAR in theaters and the impact it had on him. *""It's one of the few movies I've ever watched where I truly felt teleported to another place. That the world of Pandora felt so lived in, so real, and had so much detail that it became so easy to just imagine that I was actually there. One of my favorite examples of this is the ISV Venture Star, the huge ship that takes Jake to Pandora that you see at the start of the film. If you didn't know, James Cameron actually got NASA engineers to help him design it. And it's been called one of the most scientifically accurate spacecraft to ever appear in film. It's details like that that really push AVATAR into the hard sci-fi zone and also I think really help you to imagine that world being really real.""*

Currently, the most popular video on Avatar Guy's channel is his breakdown of the visual improvements in AVATAR: TWOW titled [Avatar 2 | Visual Improvements and Changes Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-6ihY3cjPU).

Is anyone else having some trouble sympathizing with the tulkun because of how extreme their pacifism/non-violence is?,98,112zt4t,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/112zt4t/is_anyone_else_having_some_trouble_sympathizing/,37,"Don't get me wrong, I fucking hate the human whalers and hope they all die painfully, but I think there's just something off about the tulkuns' way of life.

or

-The tulkun are absolutely incapable of defending themselves, so it wouldn't even matter

But as it stands, it's just so messed up how the herd sees one whale and her calf get cornered and slowly butchered, and they all go (Being intelligent as they are): ""Oh damn, she and her kid really drew the short straw, huh? Wow, that sucks.""

I'm sorry, but that is just so utterly fucked up! They have the power to do something, they're incredibly strong, so isn't this way of thinking borderline condoning all the slaughter? Why not just line up in front of the whaling boat and save everyone the trouble?

What if one of those big sharks starts eating a calf while they're swimming along, do they simply go ""Oh man, that's so sad. Guess she can have another one?""

I was playing through the original 2009 game and I noticed that the music in the background was quite eerie and really made you feel like you were on some dangerous alien planet, its odd when compared to the new frontiers of pandora game which mostly sounds whimsical in its soundtrack. The original 09 game as I said, felt quite unerving when you were walking about with some of the ambience, frontiers of pandora feels quite relaxing when exploring (apart from when those thanator type creatures show up).

I then thought about the movies and realised that avatar 2 feels quite different from avatar 1, I love both. I think this way be down to the fact that in the first film, pandora is new and foreign to us, also could be because a lot of the main focuses of avatar 1 aren't in 2 (like the whole going between a human and an avatar body). 

I don't know if anyone else has felt this way, I've probably explained horribly.",1707875225.0

We watch a movie when we're young. We're like: ""Wow those effects are insane, they look so real!"" 
Years pass by and you watch it again. This time, you start to notice how it doesn't actually look that photo realistic.

This has obviously been more prominent with old movies, as the CGI technology has made massive jumps since then. But in the last few years, I thought CGI has reached it's photo realistic peak and mostly (when it was a high budget movie) I didn't notice any big differences between real characters/scenes and CGI characters/scenes

Now after watching ATWOW I rewatched some MCU scenes from a few years ago and oh boy, did this movie change my view on special effects. Suddenly I go: ""Bruh this looks fake af. Like obviously fake."" Even the CGI of the first Avatar movie seems to be quite obvious all of a sudden whereas before, it was maybe a bit old but still very photo realistic.

I remember thinking in the theater that it was a terrible choice to give the tulkun ""human"" voices and 17 also thought that.

I only meant that all the loss she's experienced would lead anyone to becoming vengeful, hateful, and bloodthirsty.

They are screwed, completely and utterly, there is absolutely no hope, they cannot win. If it was just a normal insurgency to try to prevent resource extraction like we saw in the first movie then they could have a chance of throwing off the humans because they can just make the operation unprofitable. But now, if the humans think ""take Pandora or go extinct""? No price is too great.

So basically, unless we get a glimpse of Earth and the balance of power starts changing back home the Na'vi are as good as dead. I can't see an avenue where Cameron tells a Pandora centric story and the Na'vi come out in any sort of good condition. He needs to address Earth and show people taking action there, because if conditions there don't start to improve then the Na'vi are completely boned.

* Neytiri catching a fish and saying to Ronal ""Serve this up reef b*tch""

* Original script contained a kissing scene between Lo'ak and Tsireya

* A fight scene between Lo'ak and Neyeyam when Lo'ak wants to go out to warn Payakan  and Tsireya trying to get Roxto and Aonung to break it up but they both refuse cause it's a ""brother thing""""

* Lo'ak says to Neteyam about rescuing Spider ""He's our brother from another mother""

* Neytiri giving Spider a disapproving look when he wants to join the funeral for Neteyam

* Recom Zdinarsk was originally scripted to be a male and was supposed to die earlier instead of Recome Fike


* There was an extra scene of Neteyam following Lo'ak around. Neteyam says, ""You think I like babysitting you? I'm just trying to keep your dumb a** out of trouble!"" Tsireya then appears and tells Neteyam she will watch out for Lo'ak.


* Ronal tries to frame Kiri's seizure as evidence Eywa has turned her back on the Sully family. This may have been removed because it can easily be seen as a low blow towards a family with one of its members in a coma, and making Ronal to unlikable would make viewers sympathize with her less when Ro'a is killed.


* Lo'ak wanted Tsireya to teach him sign language, specifically the phrase ""We are from different worlds, but we have a connection"" this makes her blush and become flustered during this exchange.




* Aonung apologizes to Kiri for his behavior while they are hiding in an airbell from the RDA, causing her to point out the awkward timing.



* Aonung name was originally, ""Nu'ung""




* In the original script, Rotxo calls Aonung ""cuz"", raising the possibility they are cousins in the final film.



* It is Kiri and Spider who receive a hug from Jake at the end, with Tuk joining them. However, Lo'ak stands apart, unable to face his parents. Tsireya sees his anguish and reaches for him, but he pulls away ashamed. There was also originally no scene earlier where Jake says ""I see you"" to Lo'ak"" nor does Jake bother to thank Lo'ak for saving him in the SeaDragon. This was likely changed in the final version to give Lo'ak more sense of peace.


* Recom Mansk (sunglasses) was supposed to die during the forest battle by getting shot in the throat.

Thoughts on The Future of Spider’s Character,73,13xnekc,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/13xnekc/thoughts_on_the_future_of_spiders_character/,17,"(Repost due to spoilers)

Thanks to multiple leaks, so far it seems that in the coming movies, Spider will be gaining the ability to breath Pandoran air and even might be getting a neural queue.

I’ve heard many argue against this from the perspective as it’s not realistic for Spider to undergo these sudden, massive changes and it would take away from the plot for being too “magical”

However I still believe that there is a reasonable way to explain this, we know now that through the neural queue the Na’vi are able to transfer and exchange nutrients and oxygen, we also know that Eywa is capable of transferring an entire persons consciousness into another body. Assuming that Spider will be connected to Eywa when he receives the ability to breath, is it not far off to suggest that Eywa is capable of transferring DNA and RNA to a person that is connected?

Assuming this is the case, it would make sense that Spider could undergo some type of evolution given that he would’ve received genetic code allowing for this to happen?

I'm just sharing what I have noticed after watching the movie a hundred plus times. Also, these have been forwarded to production for review since I have become friends on Instagram with someone that worked extensively on this franchise 💙✨

1. When Q is handed the tranquilizer gun you'll notice the strap was over his arm (between his arm and corporal Wainfleet) and in the next shot the strap is between Q's arm and his chest.


2. In that same scene, moments later as he's walking towards the ikran you'll notice he puts his ponytail over his left shoulder on the front of his body and a few moments later you'll notice his ponytail is behind him(Right before he says ""it's just you and me cupcake"")

3.
 In the scene when they first jump into the water, take notice of Tsireya's right shoulder and the garment strap. It looks like it's in her skin. It's right before the Sully's go up for air the first time. 

4.
Neteyam's death scene. Right before Q starts talking to Jake on the COM, Jake's hands are on Neytiri's head and in the next shot his hands are on Neteyam's left arm. Seems a little too quick and hands too calm for the amount of time between one shot to the next, in my opinion.

5.
Also in this same scene, right after Jake says to Lo'ak ""put pressure on it"" notice Neteyam's choker is soaked in blood..
Moments later after Neytiri arrives, right after he says ""I want to go home"" 😭 no blood on his choker

6.
One of the last fight scenes you'll see Jake throwing a human into recom Mansk and he falls over a big pipe but in the next shot Recom Mansk or that human or nowhere to be found

7. (3/30)
Just noticed another one.. in the scene where Q says ""Why so blue?"" I noticed that Recom Brown (I believe), who is standing in front of Recom Lopez (Recom with no shirt on in the back left). Brown is standing up straight in the first shot then the next he's hunched over, foot on the seat & resting his arm on his knee

8. (3/30)
Just noticed another one.. when Q and the recoms first go to the Sea Dragon you'll notice Dr. G drinking a cup of something (probably liquor lol) in the initial shot in his left hand and the next shot right before they head outside to meet the recoms you'll see the cup is now in his right hand and he downs it 🥃

9. (4/6)
Also in Neteyam's death scene when they all are helping bring him out of the water onto the rock you'll notice Lo'ak's ponytail is between his right arm and chest.. the very next shot it's behind his left shoulder",1680126859.0

In response to the recent ban of Albert/The Avatar Podcast,72,y8egy3,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/y8egy3/in_response_to_the_recent_ban_of_albertthe_avatar/,18,"Edit to add a Tl;Dr He's been banned for harassing the moderation team for not making making him a mod after we removed him as mod for banning those criticizing his podcast, etc.

Most of you will not have heard of the drama surrounding the recent ban of Albert/The Avatar Podcast. However, we felt it necessary to shed some light on this situation out of a desire to be transparent with the community. This was not a decision we made lightly, but one that we decided upon after numerous repeated issues with his interactions with the community.

Some of you may remember that half a year ago or so now, we had an almost entirely different mod team. Many of the mods were no longer active when I joined the team. As 2022 came, I really wanted to turn this subreddit around and give it the love it deserved, since the Avatar franchise would finally be returning to the big screen. Around that same time, Kelutral reached out to me and said they would love to help revitalize the subreddit. This was great because we were able to connect with the broader community and gain access to resources the subreddit did not have at the time. The Kelutral team has been a huge help, although only two of the current mods are principally Kelutral users. The majority of us spend most of our time in the Avatar community through r/Avatar, including myself. The transition to a new mod team was understandably rocky for a bit, but things have worked themselves out and the subreddit is in the best place it has been for a long time.

Besides inactivity, one of the major reasons for the restructuring of the mod team was Albert’s conduct as a moderator. The most prominent issue being that many users of this subreddit had expressed to me and in the comments that Albert was promoting his podcast, especially through his role as mod, to the point of spam. I had also noticed once I became a mod (on the old mod team) that Albert was removing any comments which criticized his podcast or his contributions/decisions regarding the subreddit. To make matters worse, he even banned a few people simply for criticizing him or his podcast. We hadn’t even been aware of some of these bans until after the mod restructuring, when old users reached out to us and appealed their ban because Albert had banned them frivolously in the past. Considering this, we recently have gone through the ban list and tried our best to determine who we could unban, but reddit mod log information does not go back far enough for us to figure out the full extent of the situation. leraided (the head mod and creator of the subreddit) agreed that the best course of action we could take was demodding Albert, given what we knew at the time.

Things recently came to a head primarily for two reasons. Firstly, Albert has been increasingly frequent in expressing his desire for us to reinstate his position as a mod. The most recent request marks the third time since demodding him that we have had to explain that we do not feel comfortable reinstating him to the mod team, but he seems to feel entitled to a position of authority over this community.

Secondly, it has come to our attention that Albert has been using his platform to paint himself as the victim in this story to other content creators in his sphere of influence. Part of this is due to a lack of transparency to the community out of a desire to not cause unnecessary conflict, for which we owe the community an apology. In our attempts to move forward without comment, we have unwittingly given him space to freely twist the narrative regarding this change before now.

Though we believe demodding Albert was for the best, we truly wanted there to be space for him here. However, Albert has made it clear that the only acceptable outcome to him is a full reinstatement of his mod position and carte blanche to use the subreddit as a vehicle to promote his podcast.  Based on his response to the decision to demod him, we truly believe he feels entitled to be a moderator and that he has villainized multiple people within the Avatar community and the subreddit, despite the fact that it was I and leraided who made the ultimate decision.

We want r/Avatar to be a place where everyone feels welcome. However, the mod team as a whole has decided that the situation has gone too far and we will no longer be dealing with Albert’s antics. We have decided to issue a ban and we do not plan on revoking it. Albert has built a respectable following for himself on Instagram, and we wish him luck on his continued journey on that platform. **We will NOT tolerate harassment of Albert on** r/Avatar, or condone it off of r/Avatar. r/Avatar will, however, no longer host his content.

**What's going on?**

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

**What's the plan?**

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of  Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can *you* do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of [r/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/).com, who are the admins of the site: message [/u/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/reddit/): submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on [r/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/), such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.
2. **Spread the word.**  Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at [r/ModCoord](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/)  \- but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.
3. **Boycott** ***and*** **spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*\-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!
4. **Don't be a jerk.**  As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible. **This includes not harassing moderators of subreddits who have chosen not to take part**: no one likes a missionary, a used-car salesman, or a flame warrior.",1686306654.0

This Diehard Fan’s Thoughts on TWOW So Far,66,zocn46,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zocn46/this_diehard_fans_thoughts_on_twow_so_far/,20,"
- This movie is gorgeous, this we all know. I have ADHD and can’t sit still to save my life, yet I barely fidgeted through the 3-hour runtime.
- Going in with the understanding that we’re now in full franchise mode makes this movie easier to follow and allowed me to sit comfortably with unfinished/not fully fleshed out story lines knowing that they’ll be continued soon. 
- Since it’s sci-fi, I decided before release that I’d go with the flow in regards to Quaritch, Kiri, and language.
- Jake has so much more to lose in this movie. I could feel his anguish as he was proposing leaving the People to Neytiri. Making the choice to leave, giving up so much to protect his family is the heart of this movie.
- The kids were all fantastic. Being a typical middle child, married to a “perfect son” oldest child, I could really empathize with Lo’ak and his relationship with Neteyam; the love and the desire to be seen as you really are outside of someone’s shadow.
- I was surprised by how interested I am in Quaritch now. There’s a lot to be fleshed out there.
- The similarities between Jake and Quaritch were particularly interesting to me. Two examples that stood out to me: Their shared use of the word “outstanding”, when faced with a difficult task (Blue Unit being test dummies for combating Pandora’s immune response in the mountains/Jake about to choose his banshee). Their similar scenes with their banshees over their shoulders bearing their teeth when needing to convey their strength and resolve (Quaritch commandeering the whaling vessel/Jake returning to the People with Toruk). 
- I predict very interesting character development for Quaritch. He yielded killing the Tsahìk and burned the Metkayina village instead, he wanted his son to go with him in the end and the biggest event for me was his bonding with an ikran. I think he will begin to feel the Na’vi pull to the moon and the pull to Eywa; to respect the moon and all of its living beings. I could see him railing against that inner nature now that he is an Avatar, and absolutely hating how drawn he is to those feelings/urges/things. Will he be the villain to Jake this whole time? Or to the RDA? 
- James Cameron is a devout environmentalist and has said many times over that these movies have a very clear message; protect the planet. I cherish this message and admire his unyielding loyalty to his values.
- One of my main disappointments was with the soundtrack. For me, it was generic and forgettable with the only exceptions being excerpts from the OST. Avatar has a glorious soundtrack layered with different and unique instruments which all conveyed the tribal beauty of Pandora. I missed that greatly. I didn’t feel that there was the same emotional accompanying music that was poignant and memorable.
- My last big disappointment, which was due to my own hope and imagination, was not seeing Neytiri choose her new ikran. Personally, I always bond with creatures in movies over humans/humanoids. I adore Neytiri and have admired her since 2009, and I wanted to see her tackle this same ferocious task that we got to see Jake take on in Avatar.
- I do feel that we didn’t see enough of Neytiri, but I think that will change as the movies continue, this one was truly about the kids. In the end when I saw her heart rend further when he father’s bow was broken, I felt that this movie could have been redubbed as Neytiri Can’t Catch A Break. Our girl needs to win in a big way in the next movie. 
- Her rage was awe-inspiring, vicious, and truly frightening. Watching her fire an arrow through one of her victims and break necks with her bow? Wow. 
- Ronal and Tonowari were incredible and I can’t wait to see more of them
- I want an ilu",1671301763.0
Bar/Pub discussion – that moment of cringe when Neytiri pulled out the Toruk Makto card,63,11hbcgl,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/11hbcgl/barpub_discussion_that_moment_of_cringe_when/,17," *“My husband was Toruk Makto, he led the clans to victory over the sky people.”*

Oh *no*. I need another shot, hold on.

The moment of cringe passes quickly but the conviction Neytiri gives combined with the look Jake returns is \*chefs kiss\*, great acting and is well earned from the buildup of tension. Why would Neytiri think that was a strong card to play thou? Why did Jake react that way, isn’t him being Toruk Makto meaningful? **Lets have some fun dissecting and interpreting the dialogue**.

\-----------

To set the scene from the Metkayina perspective you just had the Sully clan land unannounced on a shoal connected to their village and you have to respect this must be a rare event because *everyone* nearby, a hundred or more souls congregate and surround the Sully family before the arrival of Ronal and Tonowari. Both leaders knew *of* each other thou and recognized their features, which was a promising start to the encounter. This is surprising to me at least because unlike Tonowari, Jake isn’t wearing any regalia that would identify him as a clan leader (am I remembering this right?) – the Metkayina likely wouldn’t be aware of the change in leadership in the Omatikaya.

***Tonowari: Why have you come to us, Jake Sully?***

Notice he didn’t say Toruk Makto. The name I symbolizes what Toruk represented, a unifying force against a common problem. Jake’s narration from A1 was of course that Makto was no longer needed. Plus, its not like Jake was still riding the Toruk like it was his mid-life crisis C8 Corvette.

***Jake: We seek Uturu. Asylum, for my family.***

Ronal and Tonowari could not have been expecting this. What did this family specifically do or what had befallen them that would drive them from their home? To uproot their entire family, pack up and fly to the ocean. *It has to be serious*.

***Tonowari: We are reef people. You are forest people… your skills will mean nothing here.***

He’s a good leader trusted with the responsibility of his clan. A family of six outsiders has just landed with their mounts and they’re asking for food, shelter and protection. With little time to process this you have to appreciate this upsets their clan’s balance and it’s a reasonable, tempered response. Plus, he only has their story, even if is the Sully family. There aren’t any ingredients here for hostility yet, thou I am surprised nobody has asked why they’re asking for Uturu - perhaps it’s taboo to bring it up. Even an ELI5 version of their situation would be a stretch.

***Jake: So we will learn your ways, right?***

Ronal now takes charge and she isn’t interested in being polite and puts the Sully’s on the defensive, going all *Bad Cop* on Jake’s claim that they’ll learn the Metkayina ways. These spindly kids are going to be skilled fishermen and hunters? She goes for the jugular.

***Ronal: These children aren't even true Na'vi. There is demon blood in them!***

Neytiri hearing this **has** to be pissed and she is going to look immediately at her mate for him to have the same reaction and to, well... *react!* accordingly. *“You are going to let this bitch talk to our children this way?”*

Jake’s response is still even, appealing and tempered. **“I was human, now I’m Na’Vi, I can adapt.** ***We*** **can adapt.”** Is Jake appealing to Tonowari and not Ronal with this response? This has risk because Tonowari could interpret it as a leverage play against his mate. And then it happens. You know its coming because you’re tensing up in your seat. Neytiri has had *enough* and will be silent no longer. What does Neytiri have to respond with thou? She isn’t Jake. When the need comes, she doesn’t hesitate to fight for her clan *Unlike my husband who convinced us to run away... Uturu was asked and we’re dealing with this* *bullshit**? -Neytiri.*

***Neytiri: My husband was Toruk Makto. He led the clans to victory over the Sky People.***

Neytiri steps forward while speaking, presenting her case with her eyes locked on Noral. The words come out like she’s shoved all in with Aces but Jake has been talking up till this point like they’ve got 10-2 off-suit and need some Doyle Brunson magic to get Tonowari and Ronal to fold.

Honestly, Jake’s reaction would be my reaction because I can process a slight against my children as a distraction against the main goal and that is protection for my family. *Say your hurtful words Noral, there is something bigger at stake here and you’ll come to learn this whole endeavour is to everyone’s benefit.* *But man.* *My wife just said that, didn’t she. Fuck. This isn’t as strong a play as you’re projecting, hon. I, I gotta fix this. Oh* *no**, Ronal is speaking first and I’m still stuck here in my own head.*

***Ronal: This you call victory? Hiding among strangers? It seems Eywa has turned her back on you, Chosen One.***

*...oh fuck. She’s right. We’re here now thou. The forest is far away and we’re here, short of begging for help because I have to protect this family. Shit, they're now hissing at each other - I have to diffuse this and get on stronger footing. Let me put my hands around my mate’s shoulders and get between these two.*

***Jake: I apologize for my mate, she has flown a long way and is exhauste-***

Neytiri, if she wasn’t screaming internally has to be doing so now, *“DON’T YOU FUCKING DARE, MY-JAKE. I LOVE YOU AND I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR OUR CHILDREN BUT I WILL ONLY TAKE SO MUCH OF YOUR HORS-“*

***Neytiri: Do not apologize for me!***

*I need an exit ramp here. Tonowari, halp, pls. See, I’ve got my youngest in my arms, this is it, this is all I got – Jake*

\------

I don’t feel I’ve answered why Neytiri thought it was a strong card to play but play it she did and I love her for trying to take over the situation.

Do people actually think Avatar made no cultural impact? Is it just a case of a herd mentality where it’s been said so many times people just blindly regurgitate it? 

- Avatar has an entire section in Disney World dedicated to it

- There are Avatar comics that people buy

- There are several Avatar video games and mobile games

- The movie also inspired environmental activism after its initial release. Yes environmental activism was a thing long before, but there was a sudden spike in activism in the immediate months and years following Avatar.

- The movie also changed the way audiences expected 3D, to be immersive and as good as it

Those are some things I can think of that the movie did. And keep in mind this is ONE movie doing all this. Is there a theme park based on Scarface, or Up? Is there another stand alone movie that has done as much as Avatar? Why do people say there’s no cultural impact?",1642322692.0

There's something that bugs me about Neytiri and Spider,54,13gp46s,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/13gp46s/theres_something_that_bugs_me_about_neytiri_and/,34,"In Avatar 2, Neytiri is shown to barely tolerate Spider (even outright hating him) because he's a human - and Quaritch's son. It culminated in her trying to kill him after Neteyam's death (to her, it's ""a son for a son""), even when Quaritch released his hostage. And I must admit that it unnerves me that Neytiri was willing to kill a kid (a teen, more specifically), even if she was grieving. It doesn't sit right with me, to be honest. I can't help but see Spider as somewhat of a neglected child, who desperatly wanted to be a part of the Sully family, who tried to gain parental affection, but never managed to obtain it from the parents (or at the very least, from Neytiri). The worst part is that I understand why Neytiri was acting that way. Actually, I would even have reacted the same way if I was her : Her father, her friends, her people and now her son were taken away by the humans, and it's perfectly understandable that she would view Spider as a representative of the monsters that ruined her life. 

*But it doesn't change anything to the fact that it's wrong in many ways.* Trying to kill a teenaged boy for the sins of his father, **after** judging him all his life for his species, is extremely petty. *Understandable* and *logical*, yes, but still incredibly petty. The sins of the father does not extent to the children. If I'm 100% honest with myself, I hate to say it, but my respect for Neytiri stoop really low after that. I hope that's going to be adressed, one way or another, in the next movie.

Does Avatar have an Earth problem?,51,1atqqc9,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/1atqqc9/does_avatar_have_an_earth_problem/,38,"I think it's safe to say the fandom is very interested in Earth. Its plight, ravaged by climate change, overpopulation and resource depletion is central to the entire conflict on Pandora;. Yet the franchise is often reluctant to talk about it, keeping details vague and hidden away in secondary materials. Why is this? I feel the reasons are complicated but basically boil down to showing off Earth overly complicates the straightforward allegorical stories Cameron likes to tell. 

Earth is dying, or at least heading fast to the point of no return, the lore while vague on specifics is very clear on this. Show off this dystopian dying Earth of wastelands and megacities (basically Blade Runner/cyberpunk 2077/Judge Dredd) could cause audiences to lose hope in humanity, feel that the problems are too big and fall into r/collapse style acceptance of the inevitability of the end of human civilization on Earth.     

This then leads to two different paths. If Earth is truly doomed without salvation, audiences are going to demand that humanity somehow survives, especially a humanity that lives like we do now. This basically justifies RDA’s colonisation of Pandora which clearly knee caps the film’s established anti-imperialist, anti-colonialism messages. Cameron has said these films are about offering hope and optimism so I don’t think he’s going to kill billions (even off screen) so I think he will go for the other option, that Earth can be indeed saved. The problem is how this can be done becomes the overriding narrative issue shifting the focus away from Pandora and making the Na’vi bit parts in their own franchise.

Fixing Earth will also be complicated, with so many issues, concepts that need to be set up and explained along with tons of IRL baggage. That is going to be hard for any movie to do, let alone an action franchise focused on visual spectacle. It might be better to explore these ideas on Pandora itself as a little sandbox where things can be made straightforward and easy to understand.

So yes I do conclude that Avatar has an Earth problem and for the good of the franchise it needs to keep Earth out of focus for as long as possible. That being said this can’t last forever and we kind of know in A5 Cameron is going to shift the focus onto humanity (and presumably Earth) and ask how we (both in universe and IRL as a species) can go forward.",1708250439.0

"Is Eywa keeping the Na'vi peoples close, linguistically?",53,14igs7n,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/14igs7n/is_eywa_keeping_the_navi_peoples_close/,16,"In the 2nd movie, the reef peoples and the tree/land peoples have been separated long enough to adapt evolutionarily. Legs, arms, tails, eyes, etc. are all different. They've each adapted to fit their environment. Usually, or at least that's what it seems like on Earth, language changes a lot faster than biology. While they all have their own dialects, they can still pretty much understand each other.

I partially thought that since Pandora is smaller than Earth, that might lead to the dialects not diverging into their own languages, but Earth isn't much larger than Pandora and there is a wide range of languages in small areas. Also, as mentioned above, the different peoples are quite different physically, so, if there is enough space and isolation for those changes, then there should be enough as well for different languages. Admittedly, much of Pandora and the other different peoples remains unseen. There is a possibility there are other languages elsewhere on the moon. Two are know, the well known verbal one and the newly learned non-verbal one. The non-verbal being used when the verbal cannot.

Anyways, I realized there is one thing that really differs with the na'vi with Pandora from the humans with Earth that allows them to remain connected to their past and to other peoples. Their queues and the neural network that is Eywa. They can connect to Eywa with their queues. Even when they are completely seperate, they are still connected.

So, is Eywa keeping the different peoples of Pandora close linguistically, even when they are far away physically?",1687681258.0
