Lower limbs are a bit too human since I suspect the Na'vi didn't evolve as savanna hunters.

"I can understand the lack of a nose but the four arms make no sense. If you look at the prolemuris, they dont have four arms, they have two main arms with bifurcated forearms, suggesting that they're going to fuse together down the line. I'm also assuming Cameron (and whoever did the worldbuilding along with him) are going by the ""common ancestor"" theme instead of saying the Navi descended directly from prolemuris. I do argue that they would have breasts (you can even see Ronal's breasts getting visibly swollen in The Way of Water when she's eventually showing her pregnancy) as Cameron said they weren't *placental* mammals, but, they obviously share a log of other shit in common with earth's mammals. Honestly, I think the latter bit is more some incongruities with Cameron's navi physiology and he's probably just quietly walking back the whole ""They only have tits for the aesthetic"" thing.

"Just for the fact that we see Neytiri pregnant and the fact that she has breasts to me seems like that confirms that Navi are mammals. They apparently have a live birth and they have breasts for some reason (or they don’t and like you said they are pointless).  They fit many other definitions of mammals as well.  They have hair, are warm-blooded, have complex brains, and there young are born defenseless.  They obviously don’t lay eggs. The only thing we don’t have confirmed is do they breastfeed. 

For me, just judging from context clues in the movies, the Navi would have to be mammal. Also I don’t think mammals developing on earth negates the possibility of them being formed on Pandora. 

Again if this is explained in a book somewhere, that’s fine. But based on the movies I would guess that they are mammals.

Edit: So I just read a quote from Cameron that says they aren’t Placental mammals and the breasts are only there to make them seem human. It’s an old quote and I feel like the answer should be better than that since the world is so fleshed out. There should be a scientific, or even just a weird sci-fi, explanation somewhere.

None, even the Prolemurai arms seem off, but that I can see, but anything before or after in that fusing process is useless.

Wouldn't it just make more sense for riders to connect to the animals that have two queues, with another *pair* of their own queues? That would technically make a stronger bond, no?

"I dont find the Na'vi attractive (mainly cause they're not my thing to begin with) but i do acknowledge many of them are good looking, which makes sense considering how that was pretty much the intention behind their overall looks.

Funny enough though when the Way of Water trailer came out i once made a remark on Discord about Tsireya looking pretty (again, Na'vi are not my thing, especially with Tsireya being underaged and all but i genuinely find her design to be nice looking and even kinda cute) and some folks there legit thought i was a furry for saying that.

Also, on the other side of the spectrum, i've met several folks that said they find the Na'vi to be uncanny and even ugly looking (especially the Metkayina with their comparatively bigger eyes) and so in that regard i can see why those same persons might think of other people finding them hot as weird, even though there's plenty of folks out there that thirst over much MUCH bizarre stuff than the Na'vi.",4,jqjp60n,Avatar,t3_14pln9h,t3_14pln9h,1688414503.0

It’s genius really. Then you really realize why people primp up in the first place. We live in a visually pleasing society where sex sells, and good looks give you an open mic. 

Not saying it can’t be exaggerated.

"Humans are fascinating haha

I approach this all from an anthropological perspective. I used to be judgemental like ""omg what a weirdo for them finding that attractive,"" but then I thought about it and realized two things.

1) if it's *harmless* and personal (<<--KEYWORD HARMLESS) it's none of my business what makes people enjoy their fragile, oft miserable single lives in the biofilm of this floating space rock we're all on. 

2) it's ultimately just a consequence of our innate ability to project and personify ourselves (humans) onto other things. Which is actually fascinating when you ponder it!

Like someone can look at like Simba, or like someone said below the Xenomorph, or idk a Transformer I think I've seen before and apply humanity enough to it to find it attractive... well, like I said the human brain is fascinating.

Anyways. You saw my last post I think haha. I was a normal 28 year old woman, living a normal life when I saw Avatar 2 and Recombinant Quaritch took my soul to simp land in ways I've never experienced in my life lmao. A giant, blue, alien, animated, cat man....

"There are elements of this comment where I wrote a reply post elsewhere that capture my response (link below)

In short, I think it's hard to have a stopping point in ""okay you can find Na'vi attractive, but can't want to have sex with them.""

Fantasizing about such intimacy is... often the output/reaction of finding someone attractive. Not always!! But often... and I think... that's okay and not weird at all (if it's a harmless attraction).

Why are people so judgemental of people fantasizing about hot characters? What else are they hot for? And I don't mean this facetiously. It's like people are saying ""brain can look, but brain can't touch.""

Anyway, I agree that Jake and Neytiri have an amazing relationship. One of the best in media and I can't wait to see them grow 💙

"In ATWOW Jake says ""it was love af first sight"" which implies physical attraction. 

And additionally in Avatar it is clear in their first interactions the first night they met that Jake is at least slightly attracted to her in his mannerisms toward her.

He also says ""who's got a date with the chief's daughter?"" when he teases Norm and expresses a sweet voicing of her name when Grace hands him the tablet showing her. That was after that one night. He barely knew her. 

No. Jake thought she was hot from the start make no mistake. 

But he's obviously her personality is a massive factor, that's how it works! But physical attraction was the start.

I point to Jack and Rose from Titanic. Jack didn't know her, but when he first saw her when she came out to get some air on the first class deck he knew nothing about her but was infatuated. I'm using this as an example to say it's JamCam's M.O.",1,jqkjizg,Avatar,t3_14pln9h,t1_jqkhkvz,1688427790.0

Also now that my insane brain is processing it: How much uncorrupted blood samples did the RDA take back to earth to make perfect clone bodies of hybrids?

For me, it's kinda weird, no shade though. I'm gay, so I'm also into things that are weird to others (especially straight men), so I kind of get it, but I still think it's weird because even though the Na'vi are similar to humans, they are different enough for me for that to be a turn off (weird body proportions, only three fingers, blue skin that reminds me of amphibians or reptilians more than humans, tail, VERY feline features that veer into furry/bestiality territory), and I don't think I lack self-awareness because I make (and see) a distinction between the two.",2,jqjqakq,Avatar,t3_14pln9h,t1_jqjn52f,1688414965.0

I would love to see how Quaritch would handle being in Jake's situation for A1. With Varang, but instead of him betraying her, the other way around.

"So. I don't know the history of the individual you are speaking to... but like in responding to the precise words of your comment, I want to comment that 

There is a whole world of Fanfiction in which people write self insert characters to love others... sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's not. You could argue that aspects of Jake Sully are James Cameron's self insert (truly). This is a normal thing in creative worlds. You project yourself, and that's okay!!

Again, I think some stuff is definitely ""keep those deets to yourself,"" but, respectfully, it is bizarrely judgemental to say ""okay you can find Na'vi attractive, but fantasizing about them is weird""

What do you think the next step and output of finding someone attractive often is? People saying ""I would bone Jake/Neyiti/Quaritch."" That's a fantasy. Maybe they didn't write it down... but it is a fantasy. 

I wrote a massive Avatar 3 Fanfiction about Quaritch where he falls in love with an original Na'vi character as Jake did. She's not me. I'm not her. She however, has aspects of myself, certainly. Because I know myself and it's easy and enjoyable to write what you know. And part of my motivation in writing the fic *was* because I find Quaritch very hot (also in posting this meme lol) and interesting.

Am I weird? Is James Cameron weird for writing Avatar?

Again, I do not know the details of what you saw and are referring to, but I'm just responding to the implication that people fantasizing about Na'vi in various, ultimately harmless and personal ways is... odd and kind of mean to judge. Apologies.

My whole reason for posting this meme was because someone judged me in my last meme post for finding Quaritch hot 😅",7,jqj0ncw,Avatar,t3_14pln9h,t1_jqiqfhd,1688404502.0

"Ah idk I disagree with this concept you've presented regarding my missing of the nuance.

You're implying that it makes sense for the characters IN the world of Avatar to fall in love with Na'vi because they get to know them... but not an IRL human to see a Na'vi and be like, dang they're attractive.

But we as the viewers also get to know them. We literally track alongside their story arcs. We are placing ourselves in their shoes. We as Avatar fans have come to see Na'vi as people and personify them because we watch the films.

And because of this, it allows us to find attraction. Yes, some of it instant. But that's because we have the weight of the world of Avatar behind us. Or sometimes not! It can be an instant, ""I know nothing about this, but that blue being is attractive to me."" 

Like with me. So I loved Avatar 1 since its release, but didn't necessarily find Na'vi attractive until I saw Quaritch in the teaser trailer and here I am... It was just an instant, ""okay wow, Idk who that was, but a short-haired muscle-y Na'vi in mercenary gear is doing things for me"" haha

And also like take Tsireya's entrance for example (to be very clear, I want to express that I know she is a minor, bear with me regarding my point)

The way she comes out of the water is very teen movie-ish. It's setting the stage that this cute girl will be a love interest for Lo'ak. Like in an instant the audience is all supposed to find Tsireya pretty! Cute! That's the point. We don't even know her yet, but we're supposed to be like ""ooohhhh Lo'ak got a cruuusshhh aww,"" and it wouldn't work, I don't think, if she wasn't designed to be really beautiful.

The Na'vi are supposed to be appealing! To regular people.",2,jqkiqvh,Avatar,t3_14pln9h,t1_jqjqakq,1688427408.0

Kiri even calls lo’ak a penis face, and spider calls the RDA men that when he’s held hostage. People asked how she knew what it was even so young and it’s like, welp lol Kiri grew up with brothers and a culture that doesn’t withhold sex education at all.

Oh yeah of course, but since the Na'vi are literally fictional, you have to assume that these people know this... at least deep down. But I know that it can get WEIRD.

"He probably did. Mostly the good and interesting stuff. We know he probably taught them how to cuss. 

The way Lo'ak and Spider speak is much more human than the other Na'vi children. So that was definitely some of his influence. 

And him speaking to Neytiri about random earth things is definitely something I could see happening. At this point, besides Norm, she is his best friend so sharing about how he grew up, his brother etc. Would've probably happened.


Edit: Lo'ak and Neteyam's fighting style suggest also that they had some training from their dad. In the fight with the Metkayina especially, you can see more human movements compared to the Forest Na'vi style of fighting we see in both the films and the comics. The Forest Na'vi fighting style is more acrobatic, with jumps, rolls, flips and such. While Jake and Quaritch's marine style of fighting, is more subjugation, quick precise and aim to incapacitate or kill their opponent. Neteyam especially shows this in the fight with his kneeling and grappling. While Lo'ak after his initial punches, reverts to a more flailing around than grappling.

"His children use “Sky People” terminology quite a lot, as seen in the film, and crude human gestures as showed by Lo’ak, to Quaritch. Later on, Lo’ak screams, “That’s called a punch, bitch!” To Aunong, which makes it easy to assume that punching is alien to the na’vi, and was something his dad taught him to do. Neytiri even uses the word “date night” in the comics, just as Jake does in the opening of the second movie. 

If your dad had lived the majority of his life as an alien on another planet, it would be impossible not to be curious. They’d ask, and I don’t see why Jake wouldn’t answer.

Now whether Neytiri and/or their children would ask him about it is another issue entirely.

Probably the only thing that might bring about such conversations is when Norm and/or the other scientists and tech types remaining at Hell's Gate are interacting with the Na'vi or the Omaticaya clan.

"Avatar 1 only says, regarding the state of Earth: “There’s no green there.” (Jake to Tree of Souls)

Avatar 2 only says, again, regarding the state of Earth: “Earth is dying.” (Gen Ardmore to Quaritch)

To take from these two minor statements that it is “obvious” the Earth is on the verge of environmental collapse would be a rather substantial leap and a premature one at best, without further evidence from the films.

Even IF you wanted to add the deleted scene set on Earth that was cut from Avatar 1 back into the discussion then the available evidence STILL doesn’t point to that conclusion as strongly as many seem to think (based on what - I don’t know).

In that scene we see a large metropolis (Jake’s home) serviced by magnetic rail systems, which according to old lore information have completely crossed the globe and driven down greenhouse gas emissions MASSIVELY, providing cheap, fast, and safe mass transit for billions.

Additionally, we overhear a news story about cloned animals being reintroduced into zoos and parks, indicating that Jake’s statement to the Tree of Souls isn’t entirely factual. Protected zoos and parks or truly wild spaces or not, this indicates that there still do exist green places on Earth, offering hope for the future.


These things are VERY different from other depictions of post-environmental Earth in science fiction films which typically invoke such imagery as: food lines/agrifood scarcity, smog and choking air, hyper population density, weather extremes (scorching heat or wild storms), et cetera.

That these common visual stereotypes were NOT used in that scene indicates that the Earth of Cameron’s films is not totally beyond course correcting.

Indeed the negative of this statement would be totally contrary to Cameron’s own environmentalism efforts and philosophy, which are predicated on the belief that change can still stem the worse effects of climate change.",84,jxdbbi4,Avatar,t3_15ypa7q,t3_15ypa7q,1692763406.0
"I sure hope Earth is ""saved"" in some manner by the end of the story arc in Avatar 5.

Cameron has been hinting that this is where the story is going and for me, that is the logical conclusion for the story.

The whole story is a metaphor about ourselves and our planet and the future of our planet, indeed whether we and our planet will *have* a future.  We need to change the way we look at our world and our place in it and look at ourselves and what we're doing to our planet.

I think Cameron wants us to take a look inward and bring out the Na'vi side of our nature if we are to change the way we look at the world and our place in it.

I think Earth will be saved, not because it would be a ""happy"" ending but because Cameron wants us to have hope for the future.

We got to change our ways if we are to do that.

As you say Earth's governments might do it via unobtanium and fusion powered geoengineering (think carbon capture on a massive scale) or they can transplant Pandora's biomatter to earth to do the same (and massively cutting the need for unobtanium so RDA would be against that).

But I feel like the bigger thing that needs to change is humanity itself, it needs to move away from the hyperconsumerism and total exploitation personified by RDA and towards something closer to the way the na'vi live.

With all this, I’m pretty sure that in the last film, the na’vi will attempt to enlighten humanity, and help them realize that preserving the Earth and its ecology, is also preserving themselves. The other option for the film’s direction is really bleak, and the message, “humanity is hopeless and Earth is beyond saving” is not something environmental advocate James Cameron wants to convey.",5,jxe03yw,Avatar,t3_15ypa7q,t3_15ypa7q,1692781285.0

I also think Eywa's laws were created by her as a consequence of a previous Na'vi civilisation going down a similar path as humans and starting to harm Eywa in the process. At the end of the day, Eywa is a lifeform, and as such she protects herself. The best way she has found to do that is to make every other lifeform on Pandora dependent on her.

"I agree with your Post, however, I have another Theory. 

My Theory is that there is another more technologically advanced Civilisation living either on one of the 13 other Moons or the main Planet itself Polyphemus. After all James Cameron/John Landau has never denied that other Sentient Life exists on the other 13 Moons/Polyphemus itself (Please correct me, if I’m wrong on that though.) 
 
Getting back to my Theory, what if a long time ago before the “First Songs” even happened Pandora was a Moon without any life at all and the only Sentient Life was another Alien Society living on Polyphemus/Other Pandoran Moons and within that Society, they had a problem with crime. Due to the long bloody wars that happened, they were many War Criminals and other terrible people, instead of making jails to house them or just executing them, they instead decided the best course of action was to send those prisoners to another Moon that they could terraform and that Moon was Pandora. A few years later they sent the first batch of prisoners to Pandora, but not without installing a safety measure, a Security Guard if you will and it was Ewya the name itself could be an acronym for something. 

During the creation of the Ewya Program, they not only gave it super-intelligent but made sure to install a type of biological manipulator technology which would allow the Program to biologically reform any animals following its overarching Directive.
The Directive is that none of the Prisoners is to be allowed to make any Spacecraft to escape the Moon. 

The Program Ewya achieved this by first mentally modifying, the minds of the Prisoners and deleting unnecessary memories, the result being that those prisoners always think that they lived on Pandora. 
The second thing Ewya did was physically modify their bodies not just to better suit their environment but also serve as a way for “her” to better manipulate them, that included making and giving all Navi their Kuru aka the long braid that allowed them to physically connect and control animals. 

This, in turn, led to multiple Generations of Navi thinking Ewya is their “Goddess” and daring not to break even a single Rule of “The Three Laws”  

This in turn could be the main reason why Ewya made the “The Three Laws” and why one of those Laws bans the use of any metals by the Navi Race. 

TBH it wouldn’t surprise me if deep underground Pandora there was a room with a massive computer in it, this computer being the real form of Ewya.

"Came to this subreddit to make a similar post/to make sure I wasn't repeating something. For me what's weird is that there are predators.

I don't feel the need to spell everything out since you already have but essentially Eywa's connectedness is systemic and universal. She commands the fauna at Hell's gate (via wifi? Goes on to how the avatar bodies worked in the first place but that's another thing) to attack and they do. Kiri can use the motility of sea flora.

Why? Why would an entire ecology be this way? Either she created it from scratch or she has artificially selected every organism in the ecology to begin with over an infinite (functionally/narratively speaking) amount of time to the extent that it might as well have been from scratch. Why then are there predators or animals at all? It is essentially some sort of tree/plant/root network - what flora, given supreme power, would create/permit the existence of herbivores (and the attendant predators)? The evolution of any heterotroph is essentially an organism expressing the inherent selfishness of natural selection but this is a god mind organism that *is* the ecology and is thus essentially altruistic by nature - shouldn't such a system be all autotrophs?

So ok - maybe she doesn't have supreme power and we're seeing a pre-existing ecology being subverted by a superorganism mid-process. Your point about the Tulkun is interesting here. But this means delving into how she would control the ecology becomes necessary (or at least more relevant and somewhat interesting). How would she? From the start she's a root network or something - how can this exert any control whatsoever? Surely an animal would have had to evolve to be compatible and controllable by Eywa in the first place, which would make sense if she was already dominant and this came with advantages but where does her initial leverage come from?

Veratrum californicum's control of Sheep gestation and phytoestrogens potential role in the control of herbivore fertility come to mind. Maybe I'm lacking in imagination but it seem like a leap to go from subtle (and might I add universal and thus impossible as-is to fine tune to the purpose of natural selection) endocrine manipulations to full blown nervous system override. And even if this is the case then she's in the process of exterminating the unnecessary part of the ecology.

I don't think this is the case. It doesn't fit with the feeling of the movie and I don't think James Cameron (or the Avatar franchise at least) really wants a subversive narrative like that. I think a lot of the problems can be hand waved away by artificial extra-terrestrial creation. Probably Eywa being created as a biological servitor of an ecological paradise built out of the box for the purpose of the Na'vi residents (as suggested somewhere else on this thread). I think even this isn't the case as it will be perceived to cheapen Pandora as some sort of gimmicky Alien venture rather than a chance, and therefore, precious occurrence. Thus the ecology will remain an open question which may be for the best.

That ended up being much more ramble-y than I imagined so TL;DR:  
Animals are the product of natural selection not artificial selection - why does she have them in her ecology? I think she's a biological rogue servitor (I love the idea that Stellaris is creating the short hands for sci-fi concepts).",1,jnmutc3,Avatar,t3_13iryon,t3_13iryon,1686383831.0

Hardy seeds and an asteroid impact should be enough to reach those moons.

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this is actually the case and that other moons of Polyphemus have their own ecosystems with their own pseudo-Eywa worldminds that each have their own personalities and methods.

Wow. I did not know about that. Apparently the laws are older than the ""first songs"" too.

This changes a lot about my view on Eywa.

This makes it clear that Eywa understood not just the potential of the Na'vi, technology, and how these particular technologies would affect their future development... but it was *aware of metallurgy*.

"> Anyway, what do y'all think, about my Theory do you think it's right or wrong?

Well, first I'd say Polyphemus is a gas giant so you can't live on it because there's nothing to live on. The center is hydrogen compressed into liquid metal over a molten iron core.

As for the rest, it has way too many specific details that aren't based on any evidence. There's also other issues like how the advanced civilization on the other moon went unmentioned or undiscovered. They'd leave traces even if they nuked themselves to oblivion so unless they dismantled and buried every trace of their civilization themselves then you'd need something like Eywa to do it for them.

I think it's more likely that either:

1. The Na'vi's ancestors built/populated the ecosystem, gave themselves USB braids, created Eywa to manage it all, and then for whatever reason - willingly or otherwise - regressed technologically and Eywa maintains that via its laws while punishing transgressors presumably through the Na'vi or with its megafauna like it did with humans at Hell's Gate.
2. Eywa molded the ecosystem into its current form using a long-term plan and artificial selection. As the Na'vi became more capable they invented the wheel, permanent settlements, metallurgy, etc., and this led to urbanization and the unsustainable utilization of their planet's natural resources just as it did with us and for the same reasons - to make their lives easier. At some point Eywa then decided enough was enough and *somehow* erased every trace of that civilization so thoroughly that *not even the memory of it remains* and sends them back to the stone age with the three laws to ensure they don't go down that \[our\] path again.

I think 2 fits better but 1 is certainly plausible.

> TBH it wouldn’t surprise me if deep underground Pandora there was a room with a massive computer in it, this computer being the real form of Ewya. 

Given its special trees like the tree of voices/souls and the fact Eywa is a globe spanning neural network comprised of the interconnected roots of all the trees I wouldn't be surprised if it has some special trees with special root systems specifically bred for maximum processing power.

The ""How"" can be explained by Eywa having the ability to cull portions of itself.

Since Eywa is a superorganism whose components have heritable somatic mutations, the addition of the ability to selectively kill parts of itself essentially makes it a self-modifying organism like Tyranid or The Thing if over the long term.

This, I think, is the only way to explain the tree of souls and would definitely provide a number of means to control animal evolution.

If Eywa decides some temporary hardship and disruption is worth it to eject the Sky People then Pandora could go from being a harsh ecosystem for outsiders with occasional massive Eywa-directed coordinated attacks by megafauna to something more like the bugs in Starship Troopers; a biological hivemind with an ecology mobilized for total war.

Plus it would allow the Navi to have more time further come up with eco technology and just have more free time in general. and that’s how Ewya came to be, however there was a problem because Ewya had to manage an entire Ecosystem she was given an advanced Personality Module that allowed her to feel emotions, over time those emotions turn motherly but turned up to the extreme. Eywa decided that the Navi were not needed because it could do everything itself and put all the Navi to cryogenic sleep in a facility on an island somewhere on Pandora and used IVF to make a new generation of Navi one who will never question her rule over the Moon and if they do she would deploy her Guards (Navi who have powers like Kiri) to keep them in check.

They're at the extreme edge while the moons of Polyphemus are essentially the same distance from the sun and likely made of mostly the same material. The more important factor for the moons of Polyphemus would be their distance from the planet since its tidal forces could make it a volcanic hellscape and the radiation belt.

Still, even with your criteria consider the following:

1. The intelligence and problem solving ability it would take to transfer a human consciousness into an avatar permanently using mind probing vines on its first attempt in only a few minutes...
2. The necessary *time* and skill it would take to breed an external brain to brain neural interfaces into everything, create supercomputer trees compatible with said interfaces, and then also breed the trees to grow underwater and shit like that...

">What does any living organism gain by expanding to another ecological niche?

Typically it's to fulfill a biological imperative honed by evolution to reproduce, but reproduction and reproductive instincts don't always present that way - especially in superorganisms.

With eusocial arthropods like bees, wasps, or ants the vast majority have reproductive instincts that lead them to act for the benefit of the hive/nest/colony and to protect the queen because they're closely related to the queen genetically and the only method they have of passing on their genes is through the queen. A drone doesn't have an instinct towards ""expanding to another ecological niche"".

{Eusocial insects that do ""expand to other ecological niches"" (like soldier ants) do it by transporting their entire colony.

{Most eusocial insects are either hostile or barely tolerant of neighboring hives/nests/colonies that are related to them.

{There is an exception but I'll mention it later...

The main reason they rely on queens is because it concentrates the heritable traits that define the hive/nest/colony and eliminate competing selective pressures like sexual selection and competition that would otherwise supersede them.

(Fun fact, eusociality evolves so frequently in Hymenoptera (bees/wasps/ants) because their [haplodiploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplodiploidy) sex chromosomes)

Eywa, while a superorganism, is not like bees/wasps/ants, it does not rely on a single set of genes concentrated in a queen to dictate the structure of the superorganism therefor its evolution is not reliant on the reproduction of any single part of it.

Instead it's the inverse. *The collective structure controls reproduction.*

{This is where that exception I mentioned before comes in. In most eusocial ants with multiple queens and inter-colony cooperation *the workers manage the queens.*}

This would create an evolutionary pressure towards the collective superorganism reproducing in a way that improves the whole. Not towards creating other distinct superorganisms.

The only wrinkle there is that just as with eusocial insects, competing selective pressures would come into play that threaten the superorganism. Imagine part of it reproducing out of control like a cancer.

Interestingly enough the resolution to that is the ability to prune parts of itself (like an immune system does with cancer) in a directed way and that ability would most likely emerge from a bunch of mini-Eywa in conflict with each other.

This ability being what would allow it to take control of Pandora's ecology.

So in summary, I'd assume that if anything, Eywa likely has a reproductive instinct *against* creating independent offshoots of itself, since it can expand on its own and doesn't need the competition.",4,jkcrhto,Avatar,t3_13iryon,t1_jkcnzf6,1684238040.0

"To be candid, a lot of this is addressed in the film and lore. I think haters/fans of both sides in Avatar get this battle wrong.

Just like RDA fanboys misinterpret the film, I believe a lot of RDA-Haters misinterpret the film.

&#x200B;

1. The RDA was winning with ease until the entire biosphere of the planet turned on the RDA. The plan, despite its flaws was working as intended. No one thought Eywa would intervene.
2. SecOps and the RDA have to operate via coporate/Earth legal standards, the science team is partly responsible for this (events from earlier in the lore). So once efficient, ruthless tactics now have to be drawn out, costly engagements. (For example, the use of chemical weapons, the RDA use to just kill Na'vi by dumping waste material near their spaces. Humans don't have to breathe the air nor drink the water.)
3. Sully exacerbated a process to it's extremes in an extremely small timeframe, SecOps did not have the time nor resources to prepare the 'perfect operation'. In the background, due to security protocol even miners have to be equipped for battle.
4. You underestimate Sully's presence in the battle, he's the only one that knows how to fight SecOps properly, coordinate the defense and is on his own a capable warrior. in his Avatar body he's a veritable supersoldier, and the ideal commando you'd want. It makes perfect sense for the Colonel to target Sully. If he dies, the Na'vi lose the only person capable of coordinating effective resistance. 

SecOps isn't some Ghost Recon, UNSC Marines or Imperial Guard fighting force. They're a realistic depiction of an off-world security force. Yes, there are veterans from Earth's wars - but they are a security force not an attack force. There are severe logistical, deployment and operational limitations on them.

The entire scenario was unprecedented.

Why didn’t Quaritch just drop the fucking bombs from higher up (where the Na’vi can’t reach them) instead of going through a bunch of big floating rocks that can easily conceal an ambush?

To add on to “no recon?”, Quaritch also served with the 1st Recon. He 100% knows that he should send a Samson or two ahead first, or maybe some kind of futuristic Global Hawk, to check on the Na’vi and see what they’re planning.

"About scouts, I guess it was supposed to be Hometree v2, just more of useless arrows and that's all. Jake was nothing more for him than someone who banged Na'vi female.

""I want this mission high and tight. I want to be home for dinner""

I think he was 100% sure that it will be just fly over, drop bombs, return, everything with little resistance. He knew Na'vi are there, he knew about the movement on ground but he ordered air team to fire only after Na'vi started to hammer down some aircraft, well, basically it was the only order he gave during that battle. No formation, no regrouping, just violent melee and everyone on their own. Ground team completely devastated Na'vi and I guess this is what he thought will happen also in the air. He didn't expect that Na'vi will know how to attack RDA air vehicles.

>Every fuckup Quaritch makes comes back to his ego, his overwhelming hatred of Pandora that clouds his judgment, his personal thirst for glory, and his temper.

In my eyes his head scar is an image of that. It doesn't just reminds him what's waiting out there but I think it also reminds him of ""what Pandora did to him"".

> What you have to understand about Quaritch is that he's not really a military commander. He literally isn't. He's a security chief. A colonial rent-a-cop, given just enough men and material to defend the company's outpost and mining equipment. And nothing else. Yet he acts like he's Patton, some brilliant strategist that will be remembered in the history books for all time when his biggest military accomplishments we see are 1.) chopping down a tree and 2.) losing the only battle he ever commands. There's a profound hubris in everything he does. He's absolutely the single most dangerous human on Pandora, but being a good warrior doesn't mean being a good leader of armed forces. In fact, it's often a detriment.

I guess this is best conclusion of his character. At the beginning Jake said that all these guys were once marines but on Pandora they are just mercenaries for a corporation which already gives a hint. Ranger Rick is playing a military. If he wanted to play a military, then as a commander he should think about potential casualties. It also means avoiding unnecessary fight when it's not needed. I'm no military but even if he is a crap leader playing cowboy, he looks like a great soldier who could be resourceful under someone. He needed someone above him. Unfortunately we don't know the exact cause of his scar to tell anything about it more.

The amount of tunnel vision and mistakes during the battle in his AMP suits are more plot things I think. Moments of hesitations were supposed to create tension before someone interrupted him.


On the other hand, in minds of corporate figures, that think only about money, Ranger Rick was necessary and Selfridge also knew it. He was the one RDA needed to go forward. Without destruction of the Hometree, there would be no way to mine unobtanium below it and there was nothing to convince Na'vi to move. Even if school shooting did not happen, there would be zero chance to peacefully make them move. To mine that unobtanium a force was necessary.

"You’d think that the RDA SecOps would have shit like drones for both surveillance/reconnaissance and CAS purposes. Like someone else mentioned, it doesn’t take much to have a drone scout the battlefield and directly observe the enemy in real time. Absurd that they can have an airborne command and control center with enough firepower capable of wiping out Manhattan (IIRC) but they can’t have a UAV do patrols. 

I also don’t get why Quaritch made the security forces guys fight in the dense jungle where the Na’avi have an automatic home field advantage. I get that time was of the essence but you’d think that combat engineers would be sent to lay anti-personnel mines or alter the environment so that it favors the RDA. 

Someone else here brought up a good point; why hit the Tree of Souls in the first place? Sure, you might punch a fatass hole in their racial memory for the foreseeable future and traumatically kill any and all motivations to resist the RDA. But there’s an equally high chance of the Na’avi now using the destruction of the Tree of Souls as a rallying cry and justification to fight harder than ever before. Japan thought that by hitting Pearl Harbor, the Pacific Fleet would be crippled and we wouldn’t involve ourselves in a costly world war; yet 4 years later, the Japanese were signing the Instrument of Surrender on the starboard deck of the USS Missouri as it occupies Tokyo Bay. There’s also a reason why we didn’t automatically drop Fat Man or Little Boy on Tokyo when we easily had air superiority over much of Japan; we’d turn the death of Emperor Hirohito into a nationwide rallying cry for the Japanese to stand together and charge at Marines with sharpened bamboo sticks or detonate bombs on themselves. 

You’d think that it’d be best to harden down on Hell’s Gate since HG most likely has the necessary defenses to defend against the Na’avi. Instead of worrying about venturing off into the enemy’s domain, if you stay behind and fortify HG, you’re free to utilize your local resources to the max without having to stress about supply lines/logistics, contingencies, available firepower and manpower, etc.",1,iyuuaw2,Avatar,t3_y7fmq2,t3_y7fmq2,1670146136.0

This demonstrates an incredible amount of awareness, intelligence and most importantly _intention_ on Eywa's part.

As if looking at hunter gatherers today isn't an exercise in survivorship bias.
The constant migration of nomadic peoples is spurred by the threat of starvation and/or exposure if they stay in place for too long, but this can cause big problems if, for example, something were to happen to the herds they follow for hunting, or the known foraging sites had already been picked clean or trampled by wild animals.
Hunter gatherer societies were no less vulnerable to famine.

Nor is the transition into an agricultural society as binary as the article presents, early agricultural peoples would still send out hunting and foraging expeditions to supplement the limited crops they could grow, in fact, they probably made their start by planting and ""improving"" sites of temporary settlement along their usual migration routes, which would gradually make them more viable for longer stays.",4,kos3dfj,Avatar,t3_1ahketm,t1_korsqf0,1706990532.0

One of the reasons that the Na’vi don’t usually initiate The Bond with creatures other than Ikran and Direhorses is because the connection is a two way street.

I agree about the themes of individuality and authority. We can see how ""authority"" exists very differently for the humans and the Na'vi. The human authorities are faceless ""powers that be"" whose will is transmitted down the line and cannot be questioned. For the Na'vi, authority is organic, based on earned trust and respect, and the individual is more important.

"Even though Ao'nung plays the role of an antagonist him and Lo'ak are actually fairly similar. The main thing that him and Lo'ak have in common is that they both struggle to live up to their parent's expectations, more specifically their fathers. Ao'nung and Neteyam are the same age yet Neteyam is considered a man, not only to the Omaticaya but also in the eyes of all the Na'vi because he's passed all his Iknimaya rites and is a fairly experienced warrior which is why he backs down from him. Ao'nung is still considered a child; he has no tattoos, his clothing is pretty plain (clothing symbolizes hierarchy/accomplishment to the Na'vi and Tsireya's outfits are a lot more intricate than his), and he still rides an ilu, not a skimwing. Him and Lo'ak both have reckless personalities and struggle to make their parents proud but the main difference between them is how they cope with their sense of inadequacy; Lo'ak is a bit insecure and a screw-up but he has a huge heart underneath it all, but Ao'nung takes out his insecurities on others, hence the bullying. I mean Tonowari pretty much ""assigned"" Rotxo to him because he feels like he's a good influence and can teach Ao'nung to be more kind. He's the classic example of an insecure kid that tries to cover it up with false bravado and bullying others in order to feel superior.

>The thing that bothers me is how docile he is around his parents.

Ao'nung actually is in line to be Olo'eyktan, he has a lot to live up to which is why he shuts down when being scolded by his parents in the same way that Neteyam did when he was scolded by Jake. I feel like he disappoints his parents pretty often and he's used to getting yelled at, which may be why he doesn't have as much of a reaction but Tsireya does because she's not used to getting in trouble. He knows the drill; mom and dad are mad at me and the best thing to do is to shut up and listen. He's different than Lo'ak in that way, bc Lo'ak will argue back. I think he's more intimidated by his parents than Lo'ak is. Also you have to look at the context of that argument, Lo'ak bonded with an outcast, a murderer, something that is strictly forbidden. There was no way he was going against his parents about that. 


>I also don’t really get why he was such a bitch to the kids. Like ik he’s an a hole, but like…there’s gotta be more.

He's an insecure kid that takes his insecurities out on others, the Sully's were easy targets. They were outsiders that didn't know the Metkayina way and weren't physically adapted to that environment, and also had ""demon-blood"". I do believe he also did it to look more cool and powerful in front of his lackeys, who were all younger than him and looked up to him.

I don't think he's an evil person by an means, he's just struggling to live up to great leaders, the same as Lo'ak.

"One thing I'd say that stuck with me from the extended cuts of Avatar '09 that I really missed in TWOW... Mannerisms and movements. The Omatikaya are portrayed in 2009 as \*much\* more ""alien"" than in TWOW. Two scenes really stick in my mind in this respect. Firstly, when Jake is picked up by Tsu'tey and brought into Kelutral/Hometree, you see the Omatikaya both gathering round him slightly skittishly, and also climbing and hanging in the limbs of hometree to watch, hanging off vertical surfaces quite happily. The way they sleep very high off the ground in hammocks you can only reach by some gymnastics is another example of that same nature. Mo'at tasting of Jake's blood and inspection of his tale really rams it home. It's beautifully done.

The other scene is when Jake is pulled out of his body while at Hometree, and Tsu'tey is about to kill him. Neytiri intervenes and protects him. He gestures, postures and behaviour here is purely alien (vaguely like a big cat defending their prey) and is perfectly executed.

But true, Jake did not consent to parent Spider or Neytiri. If Spider being part of the Sully was an assumption, maybe only Spider thought of it that way. Jake was pretty much clear that:

His family >> above anything else.

Literally Jake brushes off Neytiri's want to attack when Tonowari reality-checked him that other Metkayina tribes are in danger because the RDA are looking for him. Like Jake's priority was very much clear that he made him and his family make such big sacrifices for the Sullies' sake even when deep down everyone was homesick. Like the whole time we don't see Jake strategizing or engaging for an attack until his kids were saving Payakan. Jake disassociates his family from war by migrating to the Metkayina, encouraging them to adapt, so that they get to live in a domestic life far away from war .

"Part 2

**Sequence 7 (1:13:00-1:21:30) “Graduation”**

THEME: [this one took some work to figure out!] On a first pass, I had decided that the theme of this sequence was “The Choice.” I know, it sounds generic. And it is. That’s because it’s clear that this sequence had been gutted of some central elements, leaving only one source of tension. That conflict is Jake having to decide between continuing with his quest to become a member of the Omaticaya clan OR returning to Earth, immediately – that same day – to receive surgery on his spine that will give him back the use of his own, human legs. This is an unequivocal point of no return.

This is the shortest sequence in the entire movie at only 8.5 minutes. And I found that nearly 10 pages of material from this part of the script are either relocated or outright missing from the movie. The first 4.5 minutes of the sequence introduce the Tree of Souls (a new location!), the Toruk, and the Toruk Macto. There’s a one minute scene where Jake claims to have forgotten his old life. Then we get the critical meeting with Quaritch. And the sequence ends with a shockingly brief initiation ceremony.

Most of the first half of this sequence essentially operates like an exposition dump. We learn about (1) the Toruk, through action, a chase scene, (2) the Tree of Souls, and (3) the Toruk Macto, via campfire story. It’s as if we’re starting a whole new movie that requires its own introduction. This actually tracks with how a movie is supposed to work, as described by my writing instructor, Jeff Gordon of Writers Boot Camp. I’m butchering it, but the first half of a movie follows a main character achieving their Want (an external, conscious goal/desire). In the second half the main character discovers their Need (the internal, subconscious goal) and faces even more difficult obstacles to attain that new goal. The way I understand it, in my mind, is that a movie is really two stories of approximately equal length – or, a one hour-long movie and its direct sequel – played back-to-back. 

But we still haven’t found the soul of this sequence. We get some clues, however, by examining the cut material: (i) an organized hunt that ends with a successful killing blow by Jake on the back of his Ikran, (ii) drinks and dancing, ending with Mo’at and Eytukan scheming to interfere with Jake and Neytiri’s relationship, (iii) after the scene with Quaritch, Jake admits to the science crew that he’s been providing intel to Quaritch behind their back, and (iv) a 3-minute long vision quest (“dream hunt”) that he is not expected to survive – the purpose is to identify his spirit animal, a necessary step before joining the Omaticaya. Jake not only survives, but discovers that his spirit animal is a Toruk. So the complete sequence, which on paper would have been 15+ minutes in length, serves multiple potential themes. They include: the Toruk and the story of the Toruk Macto, a High School Dance & Graduation, and the Hunt. The Hunt theme is supported by 1 intact scene and two deleted scenes: (a) being hunted by a Toruk, (b) taking part in an organized hunt with other Na’vi, (c) undergoing a dream hunt. 

However with the scenes that did survive the final cut the only common thread that makes sense is the concept of graduation. In the one world, among humans, he achieved his mission, delivering “usable intel” to Quaritch. And he is being rewarded with a trip back home and the use of his legs. In the other world, he’s earned the right to become part of a Na’vi clan, but to make it official must take part in a final ceremony.

Let's try to summarize the themes again: Jake (1) is an infant, (2) a toddler, (3) a child, (4) reaches puberty, (5) is a teenager being sat down for “the talk,” (6) gets his driver’s license to impress a girl, (7) asks her out to the prom right before graduation.

TIMING: Jake and Neytiri are attacked by a Toruk at 2.5 minutes (1:15:30, 29%). Then Neytiri finishes telling Jake about her grandfather, who was Toruk Macto, at 4.67 minutes (1:17:40, 55%) and wakes up, losing memory of his old life. Finally, Jake declines Jake’s offer to return home and have his legs repaired at 6.5 minutes (1:19:30, 76%), instead choosing to complete the ceremony and become one of the Omaticaya. 

Neytiri is only half present during the middle portion of this sequence. She just has as much time in the beginning and end of the sequence. This likely would not have changed much in the complete 15-minute long version, as Act IIb would have still been dominated by scenes between Jake and Grace, Selfridge, or Quaritch. And then Act III would have been 2 minutes of a vision quest. So in either case, there is a lack of a consistent dynamic presence. This is important for my analysis because the dynamic character is the one that influences the main character the most, and reveals the most information about theme.

SETUPS: 7 of 7 pay off:

Sequence 4 Setups

1. Tree of Souls.
Yes.

2. “I’d die to get samples”.
Yes.

3. Toruk.
Yes.

4. Toruk blind spot.
Yes.

5. “You’ve given me … usable intel”.
Yes.

6. Toruk Macto.
Yes.

7. Na’vi linking arms to create network.
Yes.

JOURNEY STAGE: The end of sequence 6 is expected to land on the story’s midpoint. And following that, the beginning of sequence 7 tends to coincide with a MEETING WITH THE GODDESS. Here, there is a type of celebratory period in which Jake and Neytiri joyfully fly together. This is the kind of scene you expect from a Meeting with the Goddess. And there’s even a fake Bad Guys Close In moment that is supposed to follow, when they are attacked by a Toruk. But they survive the attack without a scratch and even laugh it off – this behavior actually confirms that the Meeting with the Goddess has not yet occurred. When the Bad Guys Close In it will be by agents of the film’s true antagonist, Quaritch, if not Quaritch himself. And that doesn’t happen until the next sequence.

Although the Meeting with the Goddess is delayed, Jake and the audience are introduced to the BOON, or the ELIXIR – that magical totem that will allow them to transform the world. The Boon / Elixir is represented by the Toruk skull and the story of the Toruk Macto. We are told that the Toruk Macto can do legendary things, and that all of the clans across the world are aware and respect the title.

END OF SEQUENCE: Jake’s welcoming ceremony with the Omaticaya ends with the Na’vi linking arms to shoulders, creating a weblike network radiating out, with Jake at its center. This is strong visual foreshadowing related to how Eywa works, and a catapult into the themes explored in the sequence that follows (8)...

SPOILER: This sequence (7) closes out the preliminary stages of maturation, which are essentially physical, concerning the body and grappling with sexual maturation. Now adulthood has been reached. Jake has attained a level where he is entrusted with responsibilities (at least, with the Na’vi… in contrast he seems to have damaged his human relationships). The next sequences hone in on a maturation in the dimensions of the spiritual and the divine.",2,j0fdnb6,Avatar,t3_zn7gwq,t3_zn7gwq,1671170189.0
"Part 4

**Sequence 9 (1:34:20-1:48:15) “Attack on Hometree” and “Everybody Hates Jake”**

THEME: The sequence starts with Quaritch proposing an attack plan to Selfridge, who begrudgingly agrees. Then Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to warn the Na’vi to flee. At Hometree Jake admits to knowing that he had known about this eventuality since the beginning. So Jake and Grace are both strung up, pilloried, at the foot of the giant tree just as the gunships arrive. When rockets hit the tree Neytiri flees with her people, leaving the avatars stranded. But Mo’at frees them before they are killed by the debris. Eytukan, however, does not survive, getting shanked by a huge piece of the tree. When the gunships leave, Jake finds Neytiri mourning over her dead father. She banishes Jake from the clan. This is quickly followed by Quaritch unlinking Jake and Grace from their Avatars. 

I didn’t detect a stage of spiritual maturation in this sequence. Again there is an intervention on Jake’s behalf, this time due to Mo’at’s belief in Eywa – that the sign that Neytiri witnessed must mean that Jake has a destiny beyond this betrayal. And I suppose you could argue that Jake owning up to his deception is an internal obstacle he had to clear before he could move on to further levels of maturity.

TIMING: At 2.6 minutes in Jake is amongst the Omaticaya trying to convince them that the humans are advancing on Hometree (1:37:00, 19%) and that he had known about this the whole time. He and Grace are pilloried for this and left behind as soon as the explosions begin. But Mo’at frees them at 7.2 minutes (1:41:30, 50%). After Hometree falls Neytiri finds her gravely wounded father at 11.5 minutes (1:45:45, 82%). This is not only the whiff of death and low point for the sequence, but for the entire movie! After this moment, Jake is immediately banished by Neytiri, and then Jake and Grace are unlinked by Quaritch and put in a jail cell. All is Lost.

SETUPS: There’s only 1 setup in this sequence and I don’t think it pays off like it was meant to. When Eytukan hands over his bow to Neytiri. His last words to her are, “Daughter – take my bow. Protect the People.” I think this is generally read by the audience as a passing of authority. But the movie does not portray her as having any elevated level of authority after this moment. In fact the only real satisfactory pay off for this moment is that Neytiri kills Quaritch with that same bow. So she got revenge… or did she? The movie doesn’t make that moment (in sequence 12) at all feel significant with respect to her father, or achieving some kind of personal satisfaction. 

JOURNEY STAGES: The 9th sequence is expected to have a WHIFF OF DEATH and an ALL IS LOST stage. The WHIFF OF DEATH is clearly the actual death of Eytukan. ALL IS LOST starts much earlier in the sequence, when Jake finally admits that he had been holding back information on the human’s plans from Omaticaya. This is when Neytiri’s heart is first torn and Jake’s relationship with her is irreconcilably damaged. But the stage really reaches its most pronounced point when Neytiri demands that Jake leave and never return. Everything Jake had been working towards, all his accomplishments over the last 3 months have been nullified. He’s at a place further back than square 1. There are posters up on the wall that say don’t even let this man inside. And to make matters worse for him, he has also been caught betraying the humans (or his employers, if you don’t want to be too dramatic about it.) Now he’s jailed, and separated from a link unit. So he is not only back to his original physical limitations but has  even fewer privileges than he had on the first day in Pandora.

"Part 6

**Sequence 11 (2:02:00-2:14:23) “Gathering the Armies”**

THEME: The theme here is available right on the surface. Jake begins the sequence with a rousing speech to the Omaticaya, with a plan to recruit help from other clans across Pandora. Then they quickly travel to distant clans and are not just heard, but they are successful in bringing back soldiers and swelling the numbers at the Tree of Souls. A nervous Quaritch notices the numbers of Na’vi growing and prepares his people to execute a pre-emptive attack. By the end of the sequence both armies have gathered above and below the rainforest canopy and are within striking distance.

In this sequence Jake takes another step of maturity in that first level towards non-dualistic spiritual transcendence. As a reminder, that first level is acknowledgement of the divine and a desire to commune with it. Jake was introduced with the concept of communing with Eywa by Neytiri at the Willow Glade. In this sequence he goes to speak with Eywa alone (as far as he was aware) at the Tree of Souls -- a scene which is of course clearly a nod to Jesus at Gethsemane. (I don't understand what this reference implies however -- Jesus was fully aware of his destiny and the pain and torture he was about to face. Jesus understood the coming suffering so viscerally that his sweat came out as blood while he begged God to take that cup away from him. In contrast, Jake probably understood this was a last stand situation with very little chance of survival, but there's no we he had a full premonition of what was to come... right?)

TIMING: After giving his speech to the Omaticaya as Toruk Macto he travels at 2.5 minutes (2:04:30, 20%) to other clans to recruit help. Then Quaritch finishes his own speech to his troops at 6.33 (2:08:20, 51%). Then at 9.5 minutes (2:11:30, 76%) the first of human troops enter the rainforest and (presumably) head towards the Tree of Souls. The sequence transitions to the activity in the skies to the point right before Jake ambushes a gunship to start the war.

SETUPS: Jake’s prayer to Eywa will pay off in the next sequence. This is part of a daisy chain of setups that began way back in sequence 6, during the montage when the flow of energy was introduced. And as far as the pieces that will be put in play, we can go back further, to sequence 3 when we’re introduced to three dangerous species of forest denizens. 

The daisy chain of setups: Titanotheres, Thanator, Viperwolves -> Flow of Energy (showing an elderly Na’vi being uploaded to Eywa’s consciousness) -> Tree of Voices (demonstrates the the souls live on within the consciousness) -> Grace’s mortal wound & and a failed attempt to transfer her soul results in her abiding with Eywa -> Jake begs Eywa for help (Grace intercedes) -> ??? -> Profit

JOURNEY STAGES: Jake uses the ELIXIR here, immediately, to transform the world. By uniting the clans, Jake has given the Omaticaya a fighting chance to save themselves and fight off the humans. The only remaining stages are: the LAST BATTLE and the DENOUEMENT (aka EPILOGUE). Those occur in the next and final sequence…",2,j0fdyy5,Avatar,t3_zn7gwq,t3_zn7gwq,1671170406.0
"Part 7

**Sequence 12 (2:14:23-2:35:00) “To the Death”**

THEME: The Na’vi take heavy losses at the start. Neytiri is about to go on a kamikaze attack when Eywa intervenes. The deity turns the tide when hammerheads stampede and viperwolves overwhelm the human troops. A Thanator finds Neytiri and allows itself to bond with her. (Btw, the greek word Thanatos means ‘The personification of death’). Jake then kills the superheavy gunship and both Quaritch and Jake miraculously survive the fall to the rainforest floor. Quaritch kills Neytiri’s Thanator. And just before Quaritch kills Neytiri herself Jake arrives and battles him mano-a-mano. Fighting near the science team’s remote station Quaritch breaks one of its windows to let in the planet’s toxic atmosphere. With Jake asphyxiating Neytiri frees herself from underneath the dead Thanator and shoots Quaritch to death before he can deal a killing blow to Jake’s avatar. Neytiri jumps into the research station and places a breathing apparatus over Jake’s face and saves his human body’s life. Then after sending the surviving humans packing, Jake risks his bodily existence by attempting the soul transfer that had failed with Grace. 

It takes 20 minutes but Jake does ultimately take another step on his journey to spiritual maturity by attempting the soul transfer procedure himself. This is him exercising his belief, his understanding, that the divine is energy and that he is okay with abiding with that energy, becoming one with Eywa. By his soul being transferred to his avatar, Jake is actually deprived of the next level of transcendence: the dissolution of the subjective – true unity with the divine, and with all reality. So he doesn’t quite reach the level of the Buddha, for example. But hey, it’s a heck of a progression for 3 months of work.

THE MATRIX is actually a great comparison for this movie. Neo also progresses through 3 stages of spiritual awakening leading to full self realization (Temet Nosce) and then a transcendental transformation into union with the Matrix itself.

TIMING:  Neytiri is about to launch a suicidal strike when a hammerhead stampede tramples the human soldiers, followed by a swarm of viperwolves. This happens at almost 7 minutes (2:21:15, 34%) into the sequence. Then after Jake destroys the superheavy gunship, Jake and Quaritch miraculously survive their falls to the ground, setting up an inevitable one on one battle. This happens at 10.5 minutes (2:25:00, 51%). Losing ground in the fight Quaritch breaks the sealed window of the research station, poisoning Jake’s human body and, by extension, stopping his avatar body from being able to fight back. This occurs at 14.5 minutes (2:28:15, or 71%).

JOURNEY STAGES: A Hollywood movie promises to pit the protagonist and antagonist in a definitive LAST BATTLE to the death. This of course happens in the final segment of this sequence. Unfortunately, Jake merely fights Quartich on purely physical terms. He doesn’t use his lessons of spiritual maturation, or even the special customs or ways of the Na’vi, or take particular advantage of the setting (in a way that a native of that land would) to get an edge in the fight. In truth, Jake had already used up his elixir (the authority of the Toruk Macto) to gather the Na’vi clans – that was how he won the battle, in advance.

The DENOUEMENT (or EPILOGUE) is where the test of Jake’s faith and his spiritual maturity takes place. From this analysis, it’s tough to decide whether he passed or failed that test. If this movie was primarily interested in his journey to transcendence, then this was a setback. A rejection by the deity. But if this structure was more about creating a scaffold for positing the philosophy, but ultimately serving more traditional Hollywood action movie expectations, then Jake’s transfer is easily seen as a win.

**FINAL NOTE:**

What y’all think? 

This took me a long time to parse. Reverse engineering can take serious time. I’ve actually gotten faster at it through this experiment, also completing breakdowns of The Matrix and even My Dinner with Andre (of all movies). But I was actually super impressed by the structure of this movie. It plays with conventional Hero’s Journey stages a bit too loosely (e.g., having a false midpoint twist, and then delaying the Meeting with the Goddess by a full sequence – remember the chain of dominoes! There’s consequences to not placing them at regular distances!), and it clearly indulges itself in Act IIa (what’s supposed to be the second 25% of the story, but is instead 31% – from minute 36 to minute 84 out of 155 total minutes) as well as in Act III (29% of the total length instead of 25%). But way more often than not the film respects the format. Moreover, using a consistent framework of a Hindu-inspired physical to spiritual transformation without beating us over the head with it is surprisingly subtle execution.

The structure did get a bit mangled in the second half, first in sequence 7, when the editors had to trim and/or relocate 10 pages worth of material, and later in sequence 9, when they instead focused on delivering a visceral and primarily visual All is Lost experience. They also got distracted, maybe derailed, by an enormous and similarly visceral and visual final battle sequence. But ultimately, I think the intentionality of the progression of spiritual maturity survived – at least in the story that the structure told me.

Now I’m off to see The Way of Water!",2,j0fe0ft,Avatar,t3_zn7gwq,t3_zn7gwq,1671170432.0

**Sequence 8 (1:21:30-1:34:20) “Neural Networks & Memory”**

THEME: This sequence represents the most clear expression of theme in the whole film. The sequence begins with Neytiri bringing Jake to a Willow Glade and the Tree of Voices where Na’vi can connect to some corner of Eywa’s mind, plugging in as if with a USB cable, to hear the voices of the dead. Then they USB each other. (Thinking about it, the human equivalent would be the most goth activity possible. I mean … they had sex at a cemetery.) Neytiri will refer to this as having mated before Eywa, a type of permanent stamp or a recording (eww), i.e. Eywa as a witness. 

Once his avatar falls asleep Jake unlinks, refreshes himself, then quickly returns to the Willow Glade only to find it being razed by bulldozers. After barely avoiding getting crushed, he attacks a dozer and breaks its cameras, stopping its progress. (Cameras are digital eyes that transmit information over electrical conduits just like optic nerve axons* – my research specialty is in vision, so I immediately made the ‘connection’ between crushing the neuron-like roots of Pandoran trees and crushing a machine’s digital eyes). But this action means that his image is captured and sent to Quaritch and Selfridge. This freeze frame of Jake is another parallel example of a digital memory. Then, back at Selfridge’s hologram table Grace unveils her theory of the neural network that spans all the trees of Pandora and creates a type of brain, a consciousness. Finally, Quaritch reveals one of Jake’s video logs – another type of digital memory or recording, in which he explains that the Na’vi will never negotiate with the humans. There is nothing we can offer them.

For Jake, and his personal journey, these are his first steps in communing with the spirit of Eywa, i.e, with the divine. He’s beginning to understand the Hindu concept of non-dualism that Neytiri has been espousing, e.g. the flow of energy returning to Eywa. 

TIMING: At 2.5 minutes (1:24:00, 21%) Jake and Neytiri mate (we cut immediately to Jake waking up at the research station). Then at 6.5 minutes (1:28:00, 54%) Quaritch and Selfridge examine a still image of a Na’vi that smashed one of their bulldozer’s cameras and immediately recognize it as Jake’s avatar. Meanwhile Jake and Neytiri head back to Hometree to warn the clan about the upcoming attack. But Jake is interrupted when Quaritch storms into their research station and turns off his link. This happens at 9.25 minutes (1:33:15, 77%), coinciding with the low point & dynamic separation. Tsu’tey also immediately threatens to kill Jake’s avatar, giving us the whiff of death for the sequence.

SETUPS: 2 of 2 related setups pay off.

Sequence 8 Setups

1. The dead continue on within, or as part of Eywa.
Yes.

2. Tree of Souls is a place to upload souls to Eywa.
Yes.

JOURNEY STAGES: This sequence finally brings about the MEETING WITH THE GODDESS. Jake and Neytiri mate near the beginning, at around the 2.5 minute mark (1:24:00). Typically, the characters are allowed to enjoy a moment’s respite, somewhere around 3 minutes or so, before any new conflict shows up. Here, Neytiri only gets 45 seconds before the bulldozers arrive and traumatize her. Meanwhile Jake is allowed to enjoy a break with the science team. His respite lasts less than 2 minutes before he returns to the Willow Glade and has to immediately deal with the dozers. 

Although it should probably start earlier, in sequence 7, the next expected Hero’s Journey stage is called BAD GUYS CLOSE IN. And the Bad Guys very much Close In when the mining company’s bulldozers invade and crush the Willow Glade. From here to the 75% mark, or around minute 116, things should only get worse.",1,j0fdq4z,Avatar,t3_zn7gwq,t3_zn7gwq,1671170241.0
"Part 5

**Sequence 10 (1:48:15-2:02:00) “Saving Grace”**

THEME: Jake is compelled by unseen forces to attempt a pretty literal Hail Mary to save Grace’s life. After Grace is mortally wounded during their jailbreak, Jake wastes no time transferring himself back into his avatar. Finding that his body had been left back at the ruin of Hometree he calls for his Ikran and takes to the skies. The audience is not told what his plan is until we see it in action. In one of the more abbreviated series of events in the movie, Jake blindsides a Toruk and somehow bonds with it. How do we know that? Because he immediately parks the beast at the Tree of Souls in front of what remains of the Omaticaya clan. This one act elevates Jake to a peerless level of authority, and demands to speak. Neytiri, maybe by a very mature understanding of the risk to personal well-being Jake must have undertaken to survive bonding with a Toruk – we’ll never know how close to death he came! – acknowledges Jake and his authority. She “sees” him. And Jake’s first act with this authority is to ask Mo’at to somehow intercede with Eywa and transfer Grace’s soul into her avatar.

Now, we hadn’t seen this procedure(?) performed before, so somehow Jake had enough of an understanding of how Eywa works to even formulate the plan. Was this thought somehow bestowed on him from some higher power? Was something or someone else moving through him, with knowledge that otherwise would have been outside of his first hand experience? Well that doesn’t matter (for the time being) because the process fails. However, Grace lets Jake know that she is with Eywa now. It is then implied that Grace is absorbed into Eywa’s consciousness. Her soul has been uploaded. Now this process had been shown and described to us before, as a routine end-of-life ritual for Na’vi. So this moment is not a total surprise – however, there is still tension in the scene because although we know this process is routine for Na’vi, it was not certain that such a process would work for a human.

A very cynical take on this is that Jake used the opportunity of Grace’s mortal wound to experiment with a procedure that he just cooked up. That she was the first test subject.

TIMING: The science team is rescued from prison at 3.75 minutes (1:52:00, 27%). Jake lands at the Tree of Souls as Toruk Macto at 7.75 minutes (1:56:00, 56%). Jake carries Grace’s human body to the Tree of Souls for the transfer attempt at 10.5 minutes (1:58:45, 76%). And even though the transfer is not successful, 

STAGES OF SPIRITUAL MATURITY: The events of this sequence imply that Jake is already experimenting with the process of being absorbed into the divine. This is an advanced level of spiritual maturity associated with “non-dualism”. The ultimate payoff for this philosophy is to lose subjectivity – to accept or be aware of your oneness with everything else. Now I’m no expert on this stuff, but the way I (grossly) understand it is that there are three general stages to losing subjectivity: (1) to first treat the divine as an other and beginning to commune with it (so, starting with a subjective point of view), (2) acknowledging the divine as light (or energy, or consciousness) & attempting to absorb oneself into the divine consciousness – sound familiar? – and (3) removing the subjective perspective to abide with the divine consciousness, aka being one with the divine, which so happens to transcend all of reality.

Now, Eywa itself, as we are taught by the movie, is merely the consciousness present across a vast rainforest on a single moon – not a universe expanding entity. But maybe this mini-God is enough of a test bed for exploring this kind of philosophy?

Jake has already delved into the 1st stage of nondualism, by learning how to interact with Eywa at the Tree of Voices in sequence 8. Then after Grace gets shot, Jake somehow had the idea that even a human could be absorbed into Eywa – well, in his mind as a quick stop before being downloaded into an avatar body. So, with nothing to lose he had Grace give it a try. Thankfully as a proponent of the neural network consciousness theory and the one human who understands the deity of Eywa the best, almost like an apostle, she was best the positioned individual to attempt to plug in to Eywa. Although the transfer failed, she actually arrived at the 3rd stage of non-dualistic transcendence – becoming one with Eywa. This ends up setting up the remaining stages that Jake will likely attempt:

SETUPS: 2 of 2 pay off.

Sequence 10 Setups

1. Jake as Toruk Macto will unite the clans.
Yes.

2. Grace is an ally within Eywa.
Yes.

JOURNEY STAGES: In this sequence we expect a brief stage called FLIGHT. And of course we get a literal flight when Trudy breaks the science team out of prison and flies them out on her helicopter. 

Another stage that is expected is the DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL. This stage lasts a very short time – the span of time from the audience looking at the science team in a prison cell (1:48:15) to Trudy putting a gun on their guard, initiating the escape (1:48:45). Only 30 seconds.

In movies when the dynamic character doesn’t die, like in most romantic films, this sequence also expects the main character and the dynamic to be reintroduced. This does happen at the midpoint of the sequence, when Jake lands a Toruk at the Tree of Souls. There’s no discussion or purgatory for Jake. He’s accepted back into Neytiri’s good graces right away. Well, they are mated for life, so that kind of grace should not be surprising.

Jake also claims the ELIXIR in this stage by becoming Toruk Macto. Having that universally acknowledged title will allow Jake to transform the world.

GRACE’S OBI-WAN MOMENT: Whereas Obi-Wan’s “death” in A New Hope happens at the Low Point, in the 9th sequence, Grace’s passing happens one sequence later. However, both deaths likely serve the same purpose in their respective stories. Jake’s prayer to Eywa in the next sequence (11) is (maybe!) actually heard by Grace! And she intercedes on Jake’s behalf to compel Eywa to intervene in the battle (sequence 12). In much the same way Luke made a plea to Obi-Wan for help in his own desperation in the middle of a battle. Obi-Wan’s intervention was materially different: a reminder to trust and use the force. The intervention here influences Luke’s behavior. Eywa’s intervention on the other hand results in something closer to a rescue from without (more like what happens at the end of Avengers: Endgame, ironically).

Less than one minute is given to mourning – although maybe a mourning period is not required when her passing/upload is supposed to be treated as a kind of victory. The tone of the movie is a bit muddy here, at once used to motivate Jake to take the fight to Quaritch and at the same time inserting an ally into the consciousness of Eywa.",1,j0fdx53,Avatar,t3_zn7gwq,t3_zn7gwq,1671170372.0

">SETUPS: There’s a glaring, problematic setup introduced in sequence 2 that never pays off! But 5 of the 6 total setups do resolve satisfactorily:
Sequence 2 Setup
There are MANY avatars! (where are they in the end?). No.

1. Hardly what I call glaring or problematic.

2. We see the Avatars holding guns in the last few scenes, marching the RDA out of Pandora. There's a deleted scenes that showed Max and the Avatars actively fighting the RDA - they're the ones who arrested Selfridge and shut down the Control building.

"Ah, good point. I didn't properly explain why I thought this particular setup was ""problematic"". That's because the way the movie treated the company's strategy to infiltrate the Na'vi -- any of the tribes, not necessarily the Omatikaya -- it came down to relying entirely on Jake's avatar. The story implied that no other avatars have been even allowed to get close (since the school incident -- if we're tapping into cut content). Given the artificial ticking clock introduced by the company/writing, it was heavily implied that the only way to potentially prevent bloodshed (and revenue loss), then it was Jake's avatar and no one else. However, no time was spent cinematically to show the rest of the army of avatars literally waiting in the wings. There was no effort to show any of the other avatars failing in the ambassador program. THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM: the story left room for there to be many parallel stories going on of a several to many avatars in variable states of integration or infiltration. Importantly, Quartich and Selfridge could have had back up avatars already infiltrated, maybe at a lower level of engagement/prestige, that could be monitoring Jake's progress and reporting back to the company. In other movie (e.g. Mission Impossible Rogue Nation) the company will send multiple agents to complete the same mission, without any of the agents being told that there are other agents in place -- either as backups or as insurance. BASICALLY, there could have been other parallel plans going on involving avatars that could have intervened when it became clear that Jake was altering his mission priority. 

Pretty long winded, but the 1st act presented a large enough number of avatars that I couldn't ignore, particularly in their absence during the 2nd act. I suppose the degree of severity, or level of glaringness can be debated, but I do see that as a wide open plot hole that wasn't adequately addressed in the theatrical release of the film. 

Thanks for pointing that one out. I was actually hoping to discuss the setups & payoffs for this movie. Particularly because there's no way one individual should be responsible for archiving all of these elements for an entire 2 and a half hour movie!",1,j66dosj,Avatar,t3_zn7gwq,t1_j64wn41,1674867509.0
"This might be a problem from the editing. The more complete version of the movie (and the deleted scenes that were not fully rendered), explains more about the history of the Na've-human relationships and how after the school was closed, the Avatars were banished from Hometree and its immediate surroundings. Hence why Neytiri was going to shoot Jake on sight. Norm was the Neville Longbottom of the story - he was the guy who'd trained for years to become an Avatar and mend the relationship with the Tribe because he was ""a fresh face and non-threatening, and fluent in the language."" Jake ""fell out of a tree and became the Chosen One"" instead. The deleted scenes feature Norm's mini-arc about getting over that disappointment; that ends with him and Grace (and I'm guessing a few other science-Avatars) being re-accepted into the Tribe thanks to Jake's influence, and participating in the Hunt Festival. (also deleted).  

That said, even in the edited down movie, there's an explanation for why it was Jake's Avatar and no one else's that the Omatikaya accepted as the new ambassador - his cup was empty. The other Avatars were scientists like Grace and Norm, and he was the first solider-Avatar to engage with the Omatikaya. (So Norm won't have succeeded anyway). 

> the only way to potentially prevent bloodshed (and revenue loss),

More like bloodshed and bad press. Hometree was always going to come down. Selfridge just wanted Jake to find a way to bribe or coerce the Na'vi into moving out without the bad press of a forced evacuation. (And technically Jake did find a way - the Tree of Souls was the bargaining chip that the RDA should have used to make the Na'vi move. But Quaritch wanted a war and engineered one.) The RDA didn't need infiltration, because they had brute force on their side. As Quaritch said ""the Avatar is a joke, full of limp-dick scientists."" Jake's presence as an ex-marine gave them an additional opportunity.",1,j671z6a,Avatar,t3_zn7gwq,t1_j66dosj,1674879308.0

I think on top of being a teenager Kiri is also adopted and considered weird by other Na'vi because of her physical hybrid traits.

"1. He didn’t unite “all” of the tribes just the ones that are near them. For example uniting like all of the “reef people or forest people” rather than all of Pandora. Also, the Metkayina wouldn’t have been very helpful anyway as they are water people so their skills would be of no help as they can’t ride a Pa’li nor an Ikran.

2. They most likely did not have a copy of Tom’s DNA and memories like they did with Quaritch. 

Last, Jake was faced with the conflict of either being the hero and trying to “save” Pandora like in the 1st movie or leaving that behind and instead focus on just keeping his family safe. It’s pretty obvious which one he chose.
 
Also, his biggest concern wasn’t humans mining unobtanium (which wasn’t even the human’s main focus by the 2nd movie), instead it was the fact that his family is quite literally being targeted specifically. He just watched their kids be held captive with knives to their throats so it’s quite clear that his first thought was “I need to keep them safe by going far away to a place where they can’t find us”. Which we saw wasn’t the best decision which is why by the end of ATWOW we see Jake with a more resolved demeanour as he says “I can’t save my family by running” as he opened his eyes.",16,je3d56b,Avatar,t3_1258l79,t3_1258l79,1680058026.0

Instead, Neteyam showing up through flashbacks— hell, even within Eywa because no one truly dies in the Avatar universe— would be just as satisfying. He's a charming character, love him to pieces, but he served his purpose. And that's ok.

It's important to keep in mind that he might not be asking what he asked just for the sake of Neteyam.

I understand people that say he shouldnt be back, death should stay death. But what about  Quaritch and the other humans? They came back to life after being death.

But like you also expressed JC seems really genuine and wouldnt do a Q&A if he didnt care (in my opinion).  
I hope he can tease some more stuff in the future because i really cant wait for avatar 3 !

This is how i think it CAN happen in Avatar 3. (This is my personal opinion)  
I think kiri is gonna be able to revive/resseruct Neteyam.  
But she will have to choose between Grace & Neteyam.  
Because she doesnt know what to do, she is gonna connect with the tree (with eywa)  
She will then see grace and grace will tell her not to revive/resseruct her (Because she has lived long live compared to neteyam)  
Kiri will then bring back Neteyam but will feel bad because it was her only chance for grace.  
The reason i think something like this would happen is because in interviews, when they ask Jamie Flatters (Neteyam) about if he comes back in either memories or resseruction, he like starts to smile and giggles.  
This makes me feel like there is more then just memories.  
IF they plan such a thing, its either gonna be mid movie, near the end OR Avatar 3 will end with Neteyam opening his eyes.

I absolutely love the idea of Neteyam coming back and it is possible to do so if James Cameron wants to. And it doesn’t have to take away from Lo’ak’s arc either. There are obviously some parallels with Lo’ak and Payakan. One that I thought was somewhat intriguing was when Lo’ak told Tisreya “ he knows what he did was wrong and he would never do it again.” There are so many things that foreshadowed Neteyam’s death but I’ve watched this movie multiplied times and I feel like there are small dialect clues like this that will foreshadow his coming back.,2,ja1xx3i,Avatar,t3_11byjx5,t3_11byjx5,1677391029.0

" 

This is just my theory pasted that's on my profile:

Neteyam can be brought back to life the same way Quaritch was revived: by transferring his human consciousness to his new avatar body. However,  since Neteyam does not have a human body, they can sample his DNA (from his corpse) and make a  cloned version of him in the laboratory, after the clone has fully developed they can transfer his consciousness to his cloned version of himself just like they did with Quaritch. Either Kiri or Max or any of the other scientists can do this. I'm not sure about the technology of how they actually managed to transfer Quaritch's consciousness because it was not descriptively shown. I read in an article that his memories and  DNA were transferred in a tube while he was still alive, so I'm not sure how it would work with someone that's already dead. That's where I  think Kiri steps in with her Eywa abilities to somehow transfer his consciousness by the Tree of Souls since that's where his memories are captured and she could connect him somehow.

But,  yeah that's just my theory that I wanted to share with some Neteyam enthusiasts since I'm a  huge one haha.

"This is just my theory pasted that's on my profile:

Neteyam can be brought back to life the same way Quaritch was revived: by transferring his human consciousness to his new avatar body. However,  since Neteyam does not have a human body, they can sample his DNA (from his corpse) and make a  cloned version of him in the laboratory, after the clone has fully developed they can transfer his consciousness to his cloned version of himself just like they did with Quaritch. Either Kiri or Max or any of the other scientists can do this.

"Yes, if it’s done right, and it 100% can be.

This is of course assuming JC chose not to already resurrect Neteyam since technically no one will truly know until the movies come out.

Just one example is the son for a Son/RDA continued escalation scenario. It wasn’t an equal trade—a dead son for a living son. Spider can always switch sides, Neteyam is dead. So Quaritch didn’t forever lose a son to Jake, at least not yet. But Jake did, for all intents and purposes, forever lose his son because of Quaritch.

Quaritch clearly cares for Spider at the end, hates Jake, and wants to destroy him and his family (“Jake, you betrayed me”, “I'll never stop”) What better way to get revenge for losing Spider, and traumatize your enemy then to resurrect their dead son and pit him against them? Quaritch and the RDA are relentless and cruel. Quaritch will take Neteyam—alive.

How would Neteyam be resurrected? Easy. RDA and Quaritch had 2 significant blunders against Jake and the resistance. General Ardmore MUST tame Pandora, earth is dying, there’s no alternative. Nothing is off the table. This is total war.

RDA continues to escalate their bioengineering and cloning programs. Recoms had to “go Navi” but this didn’t prevent their defeat. What they lack are truly indigenous navi minds, their memories, skills, and experience. Minds that could be twisted and controlled. Quaritch would recommend Neteyam as the first candidate with intimate knowledge and understanding of how Jake and Neytiri operate, along with his knowledge of strategic locations. The RDA would successfully extract Neteyam’s memories from the spirit tree, clone him, and alter his memories to ensure obedience and hatred for the Sullys. For this reason, Neteyam is forbidden from ever connecting to Eywa as it could repair his memories and have him turn against Quaritch/RDA. And conflict would escalate from there.",2,ja670gy,Avatar,t3_11byjx5,t1_ja2dfru,1677468133.0

True. The fact that fans are this sad of Neteyam will make Cameron even more proud of his decision and confidence of his upcoming work. It only signifies to him that his next film will be even better because A3 story will be build off the grief of Neteyam loss.,9,ja2aowx,Avatar,t3_11byjx5,t1_ja1f57d,1677400638.0
"Welcome—there’s a bunch of new folks—including myself :). Appreciate the response.

Neteyam meant something to a lot of people. And yet the exact opposite can be said for others. Does that say something about the story itself—how the audience connects and walks away with different movie experiences? When I first saw TWOW, I was definitely saddened. But its impact was amplified the more I saw it. Maybe that’s because I was more aware of the Neteyam scenes, what he stood for, and the ultimate tragedy of it all. Im excited for the digital release, but that’s unfortunately what Im not looking forward to, that, and the Tulkun hunting scene.

Some see Neteyam as a utility, and that the whole future of this franchise solely rests on his death. To your point, the “death should be final” is not a valid argument because Recoms exist and are invincible. Yours, along with many other comments here and in other posts have demonstrated multiple times the feasibility of Neteyam coming back. So people saying ""somehow"" is willful ignorance. Probability is another topic.

Im not sure what to think of Flatters reaction. I'm genuinely curious, if you could post some links where the question was asked. It could be his general reaction because he's not allowed to discuss it. But not sure if it's indicative of something bigger.

I think James Cameron is very purposeful with his plotting. If he were to bring Neteyam back, the corrupted Neteyam would make the most sense to me. There’s a clear justification for Neteyam’s return, instead of just bringing him back for the sake of it. It’s where RDA ups the ante. They decide human minds just don't cut it, even with bioengineered Navi bodies. They want Navi minds that they can control. They start extracting memories from spirit trees.  Quartich wants revenge and a fair trade. (living son) Neteyam is the first candidate recommended by Quaritch. Neteyam is brought back because of his intimate knowledge of the Sullys, to effectively combat, and emotionally torture/scar them. Neteyam has corrupted memories and vehemently hates/blames them for his death. He'd originally be tasked with hunting them down, to eliminate or imprison them with Quaritch at his side.

What frustrates me more, is that it would appear, based on A3 set photos, >!that Spider will get an Avatar body. Still not a 100% confirmed but it’s looking pretty likely.!< This could indicate new bodies can and will be created, and reinforces that Neteyam could come back legitimately. But instead, >!we’re gonna have a Navi Spider !<because we need to push this Kiri love story along.",2,jbyr7uy,Avatar,t3_11byjx5,t1_jbxvc6r,1678649684.0

"A couple of these are valid questions which weren't directly answered in the film, so I'll do my best to explain how I viewed these ""holes.""

The real reason why they didn't clone Quaritch 10 times would be because it would've made for a bizarre and convoluted viewing experience, but in-universe it'd be because there's no point having 10 Colonels without a squad/grunts. The reason the humans gave that specific group of soldiers Avatar bodies will be because they have experience with the planet—I doubt any of the survivors who went back to Earth will be rushing to get back in the fight.

On immortality: remember that cloning doesn't keep you alive. You still die, it's just a version of you that acts like you can live on. With the avatar bodies, we also have no reason to believe that humans have figured out how to permanently transfer consciousness, so you're still dependent on your host body being alive and well.

Quaritch et al are absolutely chasing Jake and Neytiri for vengeance, though he'd be given a bit of leniency with high command as Jake is so far the only Na'vi who has really proven to be a threat to the human colonisation mission—this is a guy who was able to mass an enormous Na'vi force in a very short time.

Jake left to stop the humans from looking for him. He wouldn't have been able to convince the rest of the tribe to go with him (we saw how much of a fight it was to convince Neytiri and his children), though even if he had that would have destroyed the stealth element of his relocation. There was no guarantee that human scientists like Max and Norm would have been accepted by the Metkayina, nor even that they would have had the resources to survive (human requirements would be very different from Na'vi, I can imagine).

I think with the boat hostage situation it's fair to say that Quaritch's strategy was more about presenting a real threat without having the intention to follow through, especially considering he was only really interested in Jake in that specific instance. If he takes a hostage's life he risks all hell breaking loose—and I doubt Neytiri especially would have stood idle at that point. 

The arrows both scratched the cockpits and broke them in the first film. They scratched when fired from the ground at an angle, and went straight through when fired straight from the air (with the additional momentum from an Ikran, or Skimwings in this movie). You're right about the handicap though, the humans could do with a bit of work on their cockpit structures!

I hope these are helpful and perhaps allow you to enjoy the film a bit more in hindsight, and if not then that's alright, we all have different opinions, and I'm glad we have a shared love for the first film at least!",9,j2rj5y8,Avatar,t3_1023x9d,t3_1023x9d,1672751867.0

"I don't agree with your point about Jake. the comics following the events at the end of avatar 1 explain very well Jake's state of mind in TWOW. so if you haven't read it i can't really blame you, however i think the movie gives us all the key elements to understand Jake's character.

&#x200B;

Well, about the comics, it is explained that Jake suffered from a deep depression after the destruction of the home-tree and the war against the RDA. Basically blaming himself for all the lives lost (na'vi and human), thinking that if he warned them earlier he could have avoided it (no it was inevitable in my opinion). He carries a heavy burden. It is written in AVATAR TWOW the visual dictionary, word for word : ""While Jake still an inspiring warrior and leader, his propensity to take risks has been tempered by concerns for his family and the guilt he feels for all the lives lost all those years ago"". knowing that RDA is now hunting him down and threatening to harm his family and the omaticayas, he thought that leaving and disappear will allow him to protect everybody.

&#x200B;

At this time there is nothing they can do to efficiently defeat the RDA and the sky people, especially that now it isn't about mining or whatever, it's about the whole planet conquest. And although I'm a fan of Neytiri's bravery, this is a war they can't win for now. That man was just in distress, he is not perfect, he is not a superhero.

My point, however, is that no matter that - you would *never*, as a parent, say something like that to your kid, in such a heart-breaking moment.

The fault's on Jake for his weak parenting with Loak. Blaming your kid for your parenting mistakes, especially right after his older brother dies, is completely moronic.

Yeah. 

To me, however - I think given what we know of Jake's character - it is very hard to believe he would ever make that decision, because he of all people should know it would never play out well in the long-term, and as the movie showed - not even that. They found him after just a couple of months from what it looked like, and that decision not only did endanger the water clans, but burnt their villages etc. 

He brought the war to them, and Jake should have been well aware that that was always going to happen, so I think Jake's character would have just accepted that he's got to prepare for a war instead of fleeing and asking for a new life for his family. Instead, he should have taken on the role of Toruk Makto again and gathered all clans for a counter-attack plan.

That's where I disagree. Jake absolutely did not need this character arc, because we know he's smart enough to realize there's no long-term escape.

> Any other arc would not be able to convey the movie’s message and themes

So you pretty much admit it - the arc was included, like I said, to showcase themes and messages / new environment, even if the character would never make that decision himself.

"> When has Jake failed as a parent?

I never said that. I said he had weak parenting in regards to Loak.

During the movie, he said like 5 times ""I got this, I'll straighten him out"", and each time Loak continues disobeying.

If it happens once or twice, that's one thing, but Loak did it like 5+ times. Jake's response was always the same, and as we saw - it didn't work.

So yes - in regards to specifically Loak, he did not achieve what he had to as a parent, and because of that - the whole scene of him blaming Loak, a freaking kid, for his own inability to manage him.

Really, my only issue is with that line of dialogue. It's so out of place.",2,j4obgk8,Avatar,t3_10dv9ve,t1_j4nwc1g,1673924096.0

"you didn't watch the movies, did you? your entire rant is simply telling me that you didn't listen to a thing the movies said, nor did you watch anything. 

ok, so first off. 

1. na'vi mating happens when BOTH are willing, Neytiri and Jake both said this at different points in the movie, the mating happens when they choose each other, it's not like she didn't have a choice, Neytiri could've easily said no and walked off, she wasn't arranged or anything. 
2. the na'vi Tsahaylu is not forced, if you notice at all, each bonding is completely willing by both people, they willingly reach forward their connectors with ease, ikran are different but it's not force, as they said, they choose them based on attacking them, notice a bunch of ikran flew away from jake, they did not engage or attack, Jake was challenging them, not forcing them, he didn't just jump on a random one and force their queue's to connect, when that one ikran turned to Jake to try and kill him, that's how they know that the ikran sees Jake as worthy of being his master. 
3. Earth is not and has never been the Na'vi's responsibility or problem, the earth fucked THEMSELVES up, the Na'vi is not their problem, no means no, Earth wouldn't be in that position if they took care of their planet like The na'vi did. They are two seperate planets. If the na'vi came uninvited to Earth and started forcing their ways onto humans and going around killing them because they fucked up their planet with their own doing and need a resource from earth and humans fought back, would the na'vi still be the bad guys? The RDA literally shot up a school full of children and you're defending them?
4. The Na'vi were being reasonable, the RDA are the ones that are savage and unreasonable, they're told no and then started shooting and attacking and destroying the na'vi's homes.
5. the na'vi care for all life on Pandora, they mourn and weep for any death or harm that comes to the fauna of Pandora. 
6. humans just want to destroy Pandora and make it sick and dying and overpopulated like they did with earth, they learn nothing, why would anyone support that?",18,jp0os20,Avatar,t3_14fkhvh,t3_14fkhvh,1687385584.0

"•The Na’vi lived millions of years before humanity have, and have survived that many without the need of our roads, our technology, our medicine and our education. Also, roads are useless, as not only will they not need the use of it for transport by direhorse or anything, but it kinda breaks one of three laws of Eywa: ‘Neither shall you use the turning wheel.’ Using wheels means the need for roads, damaging the plant life. Don’t they seem much happier than us? And to add to that, when the Na’vi said no, humanity acted like a spoiled child in a tantrum, not getting what they want, causing damage.

•Na’vi bonds are not forced, the characters willingly connect. Even in one arranged marriage between Sylwanin and Tsu’tey, they still loved each other very much. Did you not see the scenes in the movie where they say, ‘he will try to kill you.’ If the ikran chooses you? Also, Jake needed Neytiri’s permission and that she must also choose him. Neytiri said ‘she already has’.

•The Na’vi do not care for what humanity does, they are literally in another star system, its not their responsibility. Also, it will also break one of the three laws of Eywa if it is mined. Humanity did that damage to Earth, not the Na’vi, why should they have to pay for what they did?",8,jp10bjo,Avatar,t3_14fkhvh,t3_14fkhvh,1687390828.0

"I completely agree with you. The humans tried every method from the negotiating table before having to use force. They were actually on the verge of coming to a peaceful agreement that would have benefited the two species. If Jake had just done his fucking job in the first place, then so many people wouldn't have to die and the RDA would have been able to extract the resources without upsetting the balance of the ecosystem and avoid dislocating the native population. I think both parties should blame Jake and his simping for escslating the issue into a never-ending fully blown-out war. Also, real military personnel aren't trigger-happy destructive maniacs who go around bombing trees for fun. They would be well-trained and disciplined professionals whose only task would be to defend the humans and their colony's interests.

But I would like to see how many of these advocates would still stand by their opinion if our world was to suddenly become overpopulated with dwindling resources and we happen to find a nearby planet that is rich in life sustaining resources with a very hostile primitive alien species that is not willing to negotiate?

"1. Neytiri literally was arranged. In the beginning, Grace says Neytiri was to be mated with Tsu'Tey, hence why it was an act of defiance when she mated with Jake. He only needed Neytiri's permission because she was already engaged. But when it comes to the commoners, Neytiri literally says ""you may choose a woman,"" and starts listing them off like she's reading a catalog.
2. You do have a point. I hadn't thought about it like he was challenging them for dominance. Still pretty weird tho. I doubt that function evolved for other animals engage with and exploit. It seems unlikely a wild animal knew the stakes were eternal servitude, when it merely reacted to some blue monkey challenging it.
3. And homeless people aren't the rich's problem. Didn't stop literally every revolution in history, and I'm sure we can agree some of those were warranted. Besides, I never claimed that the na'vi had a responsibility to earth. To the contrary, the RDA does, and they neglected that responsibility for 9 years trying to come to a mutually beneficial agreement with these savages. And the answers to your questions are 'no,' and 'Idk, there's a lot of crucial information missing there.'
4. That's just factually false. They were told no, so they offered invaluble technology, built infrastructure, invested 9 years and basically handed the na'vi a blank check, then when it became clear that the na'vi had no interest in any sort of compromise, they sent a verbal warning, then waning shots, then began attacking when the na'vi shot back.
5. Indeed. True.
6. They want to build spaceships out of the unobtanium under its surface. Spaceships that, depending on how they're used, could easily solve all of earth's problems and bring an era of untold prosperity and innovation across to galaxy.",-6,jp24dx3,Avatar,t3_14fkhvh,t1_jp0os20,1687412080.0
"Oh boy...

So you're saying the na'vi had millions of more years than humanity, and while we invented near lightspeed space travel and multiple viable methods of immortality, they're still dying of alien scurvy and worshiping a god that they know is indifferent to them? I will admit that roads are completely useless to the na'vi. Idk what the RDA was thinking with that. So their god is also anti-intellectual and anti-science. Truly a benevolent creature. I'm sure the na'vi are very happy watching everything they love get burned away by aliens. If only they'd prepared literally any amount of defense... Guess Eywa didn't think that far ahead. I do agree however, that the humans did act like spoiled children. Throwing their little mutiny because the big mean colonel finally gets to kick the blue monkeys out of our mining quarry. Stealing probably millions of dollars of equipment and killing people because their whining stopped working after 9 years.

Of course they love each other. Lifeforms are usually able to adapt to circumstances, even when those are forced upon them. As for the ikran, bro really out here like ""it's ok, officer. In some cultures, if she screams and fights back, it means she secretly wanted it."" Jake didn't need Neytiri's permission. He asked for it because he comes from a culture that values consent. Neytiri literally says ""you may choose a woman,"" and starts listing them off like she's reading a catalog. In the beginning, Grace says Neytiri was to be mated with Tsu'Tey, hence why it was an act of defiance when she mated with Jake.

So nobody should have to pay for anyone else's problems? Do you hate welfare? But fr, it doesn't matter if the na'vi should or are responsible, humanity has the capability to collect what it needs without their permission. They just thought to be charitable and offer compensation. Quite altruistic, considering the na'vi's lives aren't the our problem. Why should humanity starve because some tree people are stuck in an death cult?",-4,jp22k1l,Avatar,t3_14fkhvh,t1_jp10bjo,1687410838.0

"1. She could've easily done it with someone else, it doesn't have to be jake. and yes, she lists them, because she's literally explaining the act of mating, how else would you want her to recommend women? and jake literally says ""but this woman must also choose me"" when he says he's already chosen, meaning the woman he wants has to choose him for mating to happen.  And honestly, the earth is not any better, actually worse because did you know that literal child marriage is still a thing and legal? 
2. well, pandoran animals are quite smart, i feel like they WOULD get the concept, especially with their own queue connectors, Tulkun are considered smarter than humans so it's not that far off to assume ikran are smart too. 
3. the na'vi are literally on an entirely different planet, i'm not sure why you're comparing the homeless and rich that are on the same planet, when did Earth, a seperate planet, become pandora's, also a seperate planet's problem. like what did the na'vi even do to deserve this? some random alien shows up and starts demanding to start drilling into your planet? if the RDA neglected the responsibility, why are the na'vi the ones being punished?
4. there was no need for a compromise because the humans have zero rights to pandora, there's no reason for a compromise, their planet, not ours, simple as that. warning shots? that's literally a threat, of course the na'vi would fight back, how the heck do YOU react when someone sends a warning shot at you? and it's still factual, they were still told no, the na'vi never asked them for any of the stuff they did, they were still told no and then the RDA threatened them, the Na'vi defended themselves and then the RDA shot up a bunch of na'vi and children. they're really not making themselves out to be the good guys here. they tried to force themselves and their creations onto the clans and then killed them all when told no more than once, explain how that's considered good??  Being told no is not a reason to act violently and threatening. and what do you believe they would've done anyway if the na'vi didn't defend themselves but still said no? a warning shot is just saying ""do what we say or we'll kill you"", so what good was a warning shot? threatening their lives into submission despite them doing nothing to deserve it?

"Woah, the cope in this one is intense. Talk about gross oversimplifications.

1. Like I said already, Jake asked because he's civilized and because Neytiri is breaking tribe rules by being with him. It's not the norm for na'vi. Indeed, child marriage is bad, but it is widely frowned upon.
2. I think it is. Tulkun and ikrans are wildly different animals.
3. And rich and poor live in different buildings. That's an arbitrary distinction. The na'vi are being punished for being violent barbarians, that outright reject diplomatic diplomacy.
4. The na'vi have no rights period, if that's the stance you want to take. They're not citizens or even human. And if they were, many of them would be murders or aiding and abetting wanted fugitives so Idk what point you're trying to make with ""rights."" The na'vi are primitive savages, that are actively keeping humanity from prosperity. Simple as that. The warning shots were a threat that came after almost a decade of attempted negotiations and peaceful compromise, and then normal threats. The RDA is defending humanity from continued poverty and death. The na'vi are defending big log. The RDA gave the na'vi every chance to compromise. Humanity took 9 years of suffering while the space smurfs continued to throw their tantrum. Pretty sure a threat of extinction is cause for violence. Nothing. They explicitly say in the movie that the plan was to draw the na'vi out with the gas, and then begin mining. The fighting only started because the na'vi decided to shoot at the RTA forces. Again, doesn't matter if they deserve it. Strangely, 'they don't deserve it,' has never been very dissuading when the alternative is rolling over and dying.
5. Again, not the human's problem. And there wouldn't be any problem if the na'vi knew when they were outmatched. Or if the human's would stop trying to show mercy to feral savages and bulldoze the apes.",-4,jp2d0b7,Avatar,t3_14fkhvh,t1_jp2abk5,1687418552.0

I was told so by tv.” You’re the one acting like you (or the na’vi, I suppose) know everything about ikrans. I’m pretty sure that if any animal attacks you, it generally doesn’t want your there.

2. true but na'vi creatures are smart in general, notice how that thanator literally bowed to Neytiri, there was no bond made before, it understood that he was needed or that she needed him. 
3. you're comparing buildings to planets, i mean wow, just wow. violent barbarians? how the heck would you react to someone building on your land without consent and then demanding you to trade something of yours for it when you never asked them to do that? and then when you say no, they warn you to do it or they'll kill you, they're barbarians for defending themselves? really?? 
4. humanity caused the poverty and death themselves, they don't own pandora, they never owned pandora, the na'vi not being citezens makes no sense because how are they ""not citezens"" on something that humans don't own? the na'vi are natives to pandora, the humans are the aliens there,  the humans and earth have zero ownership of pandora. and technically, humans don't own earth either, they never did, they just took it when they figured out they could overpower the ones who truly own it. 
5. savages? explain how they're savage when all they did was protect their home, no doesn't mean that humans have right of way, it never meant that, no means no, very simple. there wouldn't be any problem if the humans just didn't destroy and invade a planet that wasn't their's and then threaten and hurt the natives for no reason. 

&#x200B;

the humans are the real savages,  showing up on a place they're not invited or welcome and then building unasked for and then demanding payment for something they were never asked to build. it doesn't matter how much negotiations happened, no means no, the na'vi never asked them to do all of that.",4,jp3iflz,Avatar,t3_14fkhvh,t1_jp2d0b7,1687444657.0

2. That was after Eywa compelled all the animals to join the fight. It's possible, but that's also an apex predator. There are lots of reasons it could be smarter than the other animals, or still not at all. I'm still pretty sure that trying to kill someone is never an invitation.
3. Like I said, it's an arbitrary distinction. Nice reading comprehension tho. They literally tied Jake and Grace to a sacrificial altar and left them to burn to death. They force themselves on animals, are almost entirely nude, worship trees, and have no literature or scientific method. I couldn't make a better caricature of a primitive barbarian society if I tried.
4. The na'vi have no ruling body and so have no ownership rights. Therefore human's claim to Pandora is exactly as valid, we just have the ability to take it, regardless of how much the vermin scream and cry about it. You're the one that brought up rights. And who do you say owns earth? As far as I can see, it's entirely controlled by man.
5. Bro really out here like ""it's ok, your honor. I told the officer 'no, I won't be detained for killing that homeless man.' And so it was self defense when I killed him for trying to arrest me!"" An extremely difficult concept, I know, but just saying something, doesn't mean the literal entire universe has to conform to it. There wouldn't be any problem if the na'vi would just negotiate like adults. And how is it that you still don't understand that the reason is that humans are faced with extinction? Guess because some rich billionaires might've drained earth's resources and space smurfs want us to die, I'll just lie down and wait for death like in ""a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""

The na'vi are primitive cultists, only one tier above wild animals. Honestly, I could respect the tulkun's opinion more than these savages.

"2. why do you think eywa compelled them to fight? kill someone? who did the na'vi kill that didn't deserve it? 

3. they did that because they saw jake and grace as the enemy for hiding what the RDA were planning, duh. what do humans do? what do zoos and animal riders and bull fights do? hmm? what the na'vi do is pure compared to the shit humans have done to animals. the na'vi literally have stories, songs and their own education, a skywalker like you and others obviously wouldn't understand, a human's polluted brain would never understand the na'vi's pure and natural way of life. 

4. the humans have no ruling body and no ownership rights either. if Earth is entirely controlled by Man, Pandora is entirely controlled by na'vi, what exactly makes humans ever deserve ownership of a planet they did not ever inhabit? 

5. they killed because they were threatened, it's called self defense, or are you one of those who believe ""she said no but it still happened so i think she still wanted it""? they did negotiate like adults, they gave a calm and firm no, then they were threatened. none of it would've happened if the humans just fucked off and stopped killing innocent na'vi. I don't care that humans were faced with extinction, it's their OWN fault, they deserve to go extinct in that universe. 

Maybe if humans listened for once and actualy took care of the planet and it's flora and fauna, they wouldn't be near extinction. 

and extinction is actually exaggeration, if you actually watched the movie, you'd see that earth is already way overpopulated and in nowhere near extinction. The na'vi didn't want anyone to die, they were living happily and peacefully until humans barged in and ruined everything. and honestly, the rich are not responsible for the poor, especially when the poor did it to themselves. the na;vi aren't gonna lie down and die when they don't deserve it just because humans want them to fix a problem that they could've fixed LONG before it got out of hand. humans don't deserve pandora or it's resources. 

earth is under no ownership if pandora isn't under ownership, man has no rights to be there or on pandora if you're sticking with that logic, why can man claim earth but the na'vi can't claim pandora? despite no one else being there before them, the natives? 

pandora has never been under ownership BEFORE, so why is it odd for the na'vi, who have been there either longer or just as long as the humans have been on earth, to claim pandora after living there for utterly generations.",3,jp5jq6m,Avatar,t3_14fkhvh,t1_jp4n9da,1687474492.0

and also, here's the difference between the na'vi and humans when it comes to the animals.

"2. Eywa only took sides after jake told it to search Graces memories and behold what fate they had for Pandora. Eywa acted out of self defense, nothing more. As for killing someone, I was referring to the Ikrans, which are said to try and kill the na'vi they ""chose.""

3. Us humans are civil enough to not 'shoot the messenger.' Duh. In a time where earth is struggling for resources and space, and species have no more need for conservation, I highly doubt zoos, animal riders, or bull fights still exist. It's pretty likely that we've moved past such practices, something the na'vi still haven't done, despite apparently having had millions more years to do so.

4. Do you seriously mean to say that government and the RDA itself are canonically imaginary? Now I know you're trolling. The na'vi live in scattered tribes with populations in the hundreds at most. They couldn't even control one tree. If anything, Eywa, as the global hivemind is what controls Pandora and is the only being worth negotiating with. A mistake on Parker's part, I admit. The fact that nothing in the known universe could even hope to stop them, is why they own the planet. Strangely, antimatter reactors don't take your feelings into account.

5. Fren, you literally argued that that if she fights back, she wanted it. That's my line. Learn what negotiate means. That ain't it, chief.

Ye, there are a lot of atrocities that wouldn't have happened if one group just decided to go die. Is that a stance you take in reality too? And you do acknowledge in the next sentence that ""they should go die,"" is exactly what you mean. This question wasn't rhetorical. Please actually state your view on the matter.

> Maybe if humans listened for once and actualy took care of the planet and it's flora and fauna, they wouldn't be near extinction.

Listened to whom? They've been listening to the na'vi tell them to kys for 9 years. Is your argument here really that they should've made you specifically the supreme ruler of earth?

>  the rich are not responsible for the poor, especially when the poor did it to themselves 

Another one. Is this your stance irl, or just space racist?

>  the na;vi aren't gonna lie down and die when they don't deserve it 

Space racist. Got it. Otherwise, please tell me what the average Joe did to deserve to starve to death. Because unlike Pandora, humanity isn't governed by a hivemind that knows all and can micromanage every problem. It's made up of individuals (a scary concept on Reddit, I know) with their own knowledge bases and opinions on how to fix their problems. You're argument is literally ""how dare they not be omniscient!""

> why can man claim earth but the na'vi can't claim pandora? 

Because the na'vi have no unified society. They're akin to animals. Ants have been doing society much longer than humans and yet they don't even own the back yard they live in, because a superior species has made use of that land and can enforce its claim over it.

3. you realize that the majority of animals on earth in general at that point are already extinct right? there was literally a news report that said that they had been able to artifically breed tigers. did you see any earth animals there? no, that's because humans wiped them out with their dumb practices of hunting, riding, shooting and locking them up in captivity along with polluting their homes. Na'vi didn't do that to their planet, they respect and nuture the planet, unlike humans did to earth. 

4. exactly, Eywa and her followes, the na'vi control pandora, not humans, exactly my point and i never said the RDA and government weren't real.

They invaded a planet they had no rights being on and then threatened the natives to do what they say after being told no a million times.

that's not what racist means by the way. and honestly, the na'vi are not considered ""rich"", they live a simplistic natural life, the Unobtanium or whatever it's called is not considered money to them. and to mine for it would be violation of the laws of Eywa AND it's a violation and damage of a sacred place for them. 

the average joes destroyed and ruined earth, that's what they did to deserve it, i'm not sure how you keep forgetting this. hmm, you're saying that individuals make up earth with their individual ideas to solve problems.

There you go again with the na'vi's nonexistent rights...

The na'vi brought it on themselves, attacking an obviously stronger and more invested foe. Care to explain why big log > survival? Other than ""because elementary school logic says that I was here first!!!""

> If they just never bothered the na'vi, a lot of people from both sides would still be alive 

Factually untrue. You admitted yourself that an untold number of humans would die without unobtanium. You even said extinction is acceptable.

Also that logic could apply to a lot of things. If black people didn't exist, James Cameron wouldn't be racist. If the English didn't invade the Americas, native American tribes would still be pillaging each other. Pick literally any conflict in history. Why are you so genuinely racist?

6.2

>for years, there have been warnings, research and evidence that shows the planet is headed for a problem 

Same for the na'vi. Difference is, humanities only clear was mass death. The na'vi's clear solution was to get paid billions of dollars of equipment and tech, and instantly become the globally dominant tribe.

> As i've repeated, Pandora is not responsible for Earth's problems 

As I've repeated, humanity is not responsible for some space smurf's well-being, but they took that into account anyway because they're civilized.

> You realize that people, on earth, for years have literally been warning people to start taking care of the planet, right 

And you realize that's a goal without a plan, right? Unfortunately, wishful thinking won't keep alive the millions that rely on its resources. And most people recognize that in reality, there are logistical considerations when trying to implement a global initiative like that. And people have been listening, hence why there's already a massive push for renewable energy, electric cars, lower emissions, reforestation. People are working to protect the planet. Unfortunately again, we're not a hivemind that can restructure all of society in an instant for the whiny children stomping their feet cuz its ""nOt FaSt EnOuGh!!!""

Also you're literally saying that an entire race should be punished for the crimes of some. Do I need to elaborate on how genuinely racist you are? I mean, that has been the justification for several genocides.

6.2 not the same for na'vi actually because if you watched the movie, you'd see that the na'vi actually care about their planet and have had no reason to fear it dying, unlike humans who were warning a million times but continued their bad ways anyway. 

6.3 who? in human terms, the na'vi aren't considered rich, physical human currency is not necessary for them

Racist is being prejudiced and hateful against a specific group or race for no reason, na'vi had every reason to hate humans and it's not genocide if it was simply self defense.

The RDA threatened them, they defended themselves and then the RDA shot their children dead after something as small as vandalizing, that's a really big jump to make and act like that's justified.

"Also, given the RDA controls the funding of scientific work on Pandora, it would be very strongly in their interest to ensure that the Na'vi are absolutely not classified anywhere near humans taxonomically speaking.

"I thought the research was to find the correct combination of Human and Na'vi to create a being that could look enough like the Na'vi to allow for them to accept them.

And considering they are very humanoid with all the same parts in the same spaces with extra parts, e.g. hands, fingers, toes, legs, arms, torso, head, ears, nose, eyes, mouth etc all in roughly the same if not the exact same places, I wouldn't consider it that far of a stretch",2,jbq5w3s,Avatar,t3_11nybpl,t1_jbq32y8,1678483538.0

Anyway, pretty sure I called her ""he"" on here at least a few times. Whoops.

I should have figured it out because her name ends in a vowel sound, and female names in Na'vi usually end in vowels, but male names usually end in consonants.

"Honestly my fav part of the scene is that it’s the first time we truly get a sense of scale. 

Every other scene involving *Na’vi* and Humans (and/or Avatars of course) shows that the *Na’vi* are big but in this scene alone, the structure is designed to be a compact little shelter for *humans* specifically. We’d find it somewhat cramped in a space like this but *Neytiri,* who is of average height for an *Omaticaya* woman cannot even have her legs straightened out. 

We saw *Tsu’tey* pick up and throw a human and an Ikran bite down on the entire upper half of another human, through one of the helicopters (are they helicopters??) but we only truly get to understand the difference in scale in a structure that’s no bigger than a shipping container. 

Its mainly the small space and the angle as *Neytiri* manoeuvres towards Jake right after jumping through the open window and also that wider shot right after Jake activates his breathing apparatus and puts his hand at *Neytiri’s* face that I’m talking about lol",2,ktqfdd2,Avatar,t3_1b6p03h,t3_1b6p03h,1709794344.0

"What I'm gathering from this post is that a rather big chunk of Avatar fans, a bigger chunk than I'd expect, apparently think the RDA operated in good faith.


The Laws of Eywa explicitly prohibit using ""metals from the ground,"" so it's completely unacceptable for the Na'vi to ever allow wide-scale unobtanium mining, especially mining that would require the RDA to uproot massive hometrees. The Na'vi were open to human contact but it was clear the humans were going to keep pushing, particularly when they started bulldozing and destroying. The humans weren't there for nice cultural exchange, to share the ways of each other like Grace was doing--they were there to mine and dig.


I mean, the Na'vi are being extremely forgiving to allow the human school and avatar project and everything go through. They have every right to just tell the RDA/humans to fuck off and get off the planet. The RDA doesn't have a right to touch down and setup a basecamp, and the Na'vi really couldn't give a damn about trading for human technology. They have a mythical, close connection with the world, and no shiny metal trinkets from the humans could ever be a worthy trade.





This is how colonization works.. it's not a cartoonish mass invasion. There are often many steps and processes, small conflicts, trade and such as the colonizers steadily spread and claim more land and win battles as they escalate, as the natives stop tolerating the expansion.




There's also a third option few have spoken about: if the RDA turned their resources inward I'm sure they could have easily fixed the Earth.

"OP - why do you believe that there is an objective moral stance to be taken on any subject? Are you an objective observer of reality or do you experience the world through a subjective lens? 

If you look at Pandora through the perspective of the prey who are shot by the bows of the Navi, the Navi are evil. The reason people look through the perspective of the RDA is because they are humanity and we inherently relate to the struggle of humans. This is why it is fair to support either the Navi or the RDA. It's not that the Navi deserve what's happening to them, it's that one species must be prioritised over another and it is not inherently wrong with someone to prioritise their own kind.

"Bruh? You don't have to choose between either race's survival. Settler colonialism is not justifiable here.

We're talking about the actual justification for an action. The RDA are 100% in the wrong in this situation. They are engaging in direct settler colonialism. 

The only way in which the RDA can be justified is if you believe that a human life is worth more than a Na'Vi life. Pandora does not belong to humanity and they have no right to take it.

I have a question, if tomorrow a group of aliens came to Earth and began to genocide the human population to make room for their own because they had fucked up their own planet would you welcome them with open arms as your new rulers? Would you accept it if for instance Russia invaded the US because they wrecked their own country so they need to take the Americans so that the ""Russian race"" can survive? Do you see how stupid this logic is? 

The Na'Vi were living peacefully and happily by themselves and are not interested in what humanity has to offer. It is completely justifiable for them to kill the human colonizers just like it was justifiable for Polish people to kill Nazis colonizing their land in WW2. Defending yourself from settler colonialism is always morally justified.

The Na'Vi had nothing to do with anything going on on Earth and the idea that they owe humanity anything is ridiculous. This ignores the fact that again it's not even like the RDA has learned it's lesson and is now working to ensure they don't destroy Pandora like Earth. They are engaging in the same destructive practices and will in time destroy Pandora along with Earth while destroying the Na'Vi who actually understand how to live with nature and not destroy the land.

Sure, the RDA don't actively purge the natives, but it's because they're not supposed to.

I heavily doubt that navi enjoy diseases, parasites, killing their own children if they are too weak. Risking their lives to obtain food, taking years to do things that could've been achieved within a week if only they had appropriate tools.

Movie just builds utopian castles in the sky and is not showing you harsh daily life at pandora.

With enough technologies and energy, you can turn even desert into lush garden. Let humanity advance for another 100 years, and who knows, maybe all the knowledge gained from pandora will help to fix the earth, while humanity could help navi to take their destiny into their own hands and not to rely at so called eiwa?

There's nothing spiritual or magical about Pandora. It is a biological network. Perhaps it is sapient. And of course it would prevent development of civilization at all costs because you can do only so much with teeth and claws against steel and bullets.

Earth has no ""Mother"" to begin with. There's nothing that can control nature. It is just millions of species shaped by their environment. We, humankind, as a sapient force, we are our own mother. Nature always wanted to kill us and never gave us anything without labor or a fight.

We do not build a road around the mountain. We dig a tunnel through it straight to the launch pad to reach stars faster. Because if we reach them, potential benefits will outweight any damage done to the earth tenfold.

Whydoes everything need to be faster. In our modern society I noticed one thing. There must be as much as possible, as fast as possible and as easy as possible. But take look. Everything that we saw as revolutionary or special eventually became normal and nothing special anymore because it was as fast, as much and as easy as possible to get(medicine, electricity, Plastic or other things like a dishwasher). 
I don’t see the reason to advance because it doesn’t make us any happier.
It’s the same thing with dopamine and for example Tik Tok. You receive dopamine so easy that you lose your motivation ti really work for your dopamine. In addition to that every thing else doesn’t make as much fun as it used to do which therefore, needs it to be more easier to receive these kicks. (I compare these because they both have in common that they give us dopamine kicks).
So my point is that this is only a spiral which has our environment as price

If we only care about ourselves we are like cancer to a human. Stealing big amounts of recourses, destroying or enslaving any other living entity. 
Let me give you another example how I see it. Right now in your intestines there are billions of micro biomes filled with bacteria which helps you digesting meals. Are these bacteria stupid because they obey the rules your “suspicious hive mind” told them. Or are they primitive compared to cancer or diseases who would kill their host in order to get the needed recourses for advancing, which (I remind) don’t make us feel better.

Ask yourself who is really primitive of these two microorganisms.

I can only show the people what I love and why and trying to convince them to do so as I do. But I cannot force them.

"I would spend the resources the RDA is spending trying to conquer Pandora on improving Earth and saving the planet. Humanity has no right to take Pandora away from the Na'Vi. It is not necessary to colonize Pandora for humanity to survive. Keep in mind we have exactly one source on Earth dying in the films, the general. Not exactly a reliable source and it doesn't seem like she is super interested in helping Earth survive. Also, it's not like the RDA are even focused on the survival of the human race above all else. This can be seen in their speech and their actions. 

Look at how one of the primary goals of them is PROFIT. Why do they hunt the Tul'Kun? Money. It's supposedly funding the operations on Pandora, so my question is why is humanity not all putting all of their resources into this colonization if supposedly it is common knowledge their species is at risk? Clearly the answer here is that it isn't commonly accepted that Earth is dying. Earth is clearly still habitable, and if humanity wants to survive they need to destroy the RDA and the system that has allowed for their planet to get to the situation it is in and begin the healing process for Earth. NOT replicate the same capitalist exploitation on Pandora that led to Earth's destruction in the first place.

And even if let's say that Earth truly is dying (based on one sentence from an extremely biased person despite evidence to the contrary) it is still wrong to colonize Pandora. If a large portion of the human species has to die for Earth to stabilize that is humanities fault, NOT the Na'Vi's fault. Humanity hast has sowed the soil and now it must reap the harvest. It must fix it's own problems rather than killing another species because of a problem it created.

The thing is though, THAT'S NOT NECESSARY! The Na'Vi are clearly shown to be able to be negotiated with! Hell the Ta'unui clearly don't even care about the humans and don't fight them at all before they show up and start destroying villages and killing Tul'Kun. The Na'Vi are intelligent beings who can clearly be reasoned with and it's only the humans who are determined to make conflict for profit. The humans could have mined Unobtanium elsewhere. They could have negotiated with the Na'Vi who clearly are not densely populated everywhere but instead they choose conflict because it is the most profitable. Remember, it's the RDA who started this fight in the first place murdering Na'Vi children. Your whole argument is based off of a ridiculous hypothetical situation which isn't true because looking at the actual situation clearly reveals the side which is in the right. 

Also (even though it isn't relevant) the atomic bombing of Japan did not significantly alter the war at all. Japan was going to surrender anyway and all they wanted was the guarantee that the imperial institution would survive. The US rejected this offer and continued the war anyway and when the Japanese eventually surrendered anyway the US still kept the emperor. So basically they needlessly prolonged the war. The USSR entering the war and invading Manchuria had far more of an impact on the war than the atomic bombs did as the Japanese were hoping they would serve as mediators so they could keep part of their empire.

There was an attempt at surrendering but it needed guarantees that Japan would maintain its brutal militaristic nature and that the Emperor and his goons gets scot free from their crimes else the war continues on.

Most of the Japanese war criminals got off scot free my man including the prince you specifically brought up. In the post war period the US basically purged some scapegoats but let most stay in their positions of power including in South Korea to work against the Soviets. Also watch the video. It goes into depth on this issue. The atomic bombs did less damage than single fire bombing raids had done prior to Japan. Japan still denies the war crimes it committed to this day and regularly celebrates the soldiers who committed them. If the Americans were truly committed to changing Japan they would have executed all of the war criminals and dethroned the emperor. They could have done this very easily. Japan was absolutely devastated and totally under their control, they had ample evidence to persecute them, but they didn't for their own interests.",1,jt5o3ra,Avatar,t3_1579nzo,t1_jt5ly8g,1690140092.0
"There's no “miracle technology”, it's true, but there are technologies already available today that might help the planet such as genetic engineering which could allow us to, for example, cultivate food with less water and space, there's vertical farming and then there are more interesting solutions such as creating trees that can capture far more CO², allowing us to reverse the problem or meat grown in labs which straight out eliminates the CO² problem related to cows.

I have a question tho, what disbalance are you talking about? If I mine an asteroid or terraform a planet, who is really paying the consequences? Because I see nothing beyond rocks which we, through our subjective view, give value. I agree that we should have something parcially akin to the prime directive for intelligent life situations and a non disturbance policy with natural life containing planets similar to what we have with the Antarctic.

Another point: you seem to fear the risks about developing this technologies and the great damage that they could cause. I, in my opinion, think it partially goes against an idea that someone (I don't remember if it was you or someone else) mentioned which is inner peace.

I think that, to take such risks and have hope in a better tomorrow, we must accept that we are flawed creatures who will always be tempted to do bad things based on egoism, greed or straight out evilness and pleasure but to close ourselves in that would be, not only seeking a white and black way to look the world, but could also lead to avoid a solution. How many would be dead today had the inventor of the vaccine destroyed his investigation based on the risk of bioweapons?

I, for example, live 70 km away from a machine that generates energy based on the same physical principle which destroyed Nagasaki and Hiroshima, had we foreseen all the consequences of this tech, would we have avoided it's development or should we have avoided it? If you said that yes, then I disagree because nuclear technology seems, up till today, one of the cleanest ways to make energy and one which allows us to actively control where and how their wastes are managed unlike other sources whose wastes go straight out to the atmosphere. And that's without going into all the benefits nuclear medicine has given us in our fight against cancer.

IK most got scot free that is what I said so idk 🤷‍♂️how you make it seem I glossed it over, however that fact that Japan had a society order changed after the war should be noted as well where again Japan needed guarantees that this wouldn’t happen and it did thanks to the bomb, had the other option for this would have been to waste further lives, the atom bomb gave that justification for the Japanese government to push for a surrender.  

The only shitty part is that the Emperor and his goons got away with it after several people took blame for their crimes, however it needs to be pointed out that the Emperor staying in power is a compromise for what is I deem more important tbh, the dissolution of Japan’s imperialistic and militaristic culture that was the cause of this whole mess to begin with. It should also be noted that the US and UK at the time had been wary of Stalin and possibly China so having a local power might be a useful “ally” in the future.",2,jt5qqrz,Avatar,t3_1579nzo,t1_jt5o3ra,1690141183.0
"Genetic engineering:
I don’t like the idea of genetic engineering. We try to control and manipulate other life in order to solve the problems we’ve caused. Other life is not there to be a tool for us. Just think about an alien life manipulating our Genetik codes or treating us like we treat plants and trees, as a tool for something. Do you still think it would be ok. I just don’t think that we are so special that we can treat every other life as a tool. And look where technology and (because of your example) vaccines have brought us. To an overpopulated world where we enslave plants, animals and even ourselves in order to keep this form of lifestyle in addition to the cost the whole planet must pay.

I don’t really get your point with the fear of the dangers of technology and inner peace. Would you mind trying to explain it in another way?( little hint you don’t need to write I in my opinion think because what you think is basically your opinion😁just a little writing hint😉)

Balance:
I mean the balance of life. Not to much life and not to much death and “Giving and taking”.
You see we are disturbing the balance of life and death because we are so many. And look around what it costs us. Environmental destruction(plastic, electric waste and digging holes for resources). 
We have been taking for so long without giving something. And if you take more but give nothing sooner or later the system will collapse. I mean look at a disease. The bacteria is only taking but not giving and sooner or later you are going to die if this goes on. 

I don’t think that it’s worth the risk. This way is an attempt to become something like a god. But that’s what I think I neither want to be nor what we are meant to be. We will never have true peace if we take this path because we will never have enough. And for me this is an endless spiral of greed, pain and dying with regret.

Electricity :
That’s a general problem I see. We have bounded ourselves so much to electricity so much that we accept the environmental destruction in order for us to have it although we could learn to live without it and that’s not only the case with electricity. Plastic, houses and food from all around the world. 
And yes we can control where to put the waste but the problem is no matter where we put it, it’s only gonna make problems. 
I also think we shouldn’t be fighting against diseases and cancer on this level. I can imagine that they are some kind of system that automatically decreases population if there is to much. I mean the last thing we need in this world, where we have a big problem with recourses and food because everyone wants a house, electricity and all that stuff, are more people that also will consume more

P.s. I have no problems with long comments. I’m also interested in the other side and want do understand what and why these things and with that this way is so important to others.😁",1,jt8u6dn,Avatar,t3_1579nzo,t1_jt8mhvy,1690204282.0
"Maybe, but the interpretation of a primitivist message comes from you and really makes a lot less sense than the intended interpretations everyone else got out of it.

"Then maybe there was a misunderstanding. I was under the impression that you were advocating for seeing the RDA as portrayed in the films as morally justified. If that isn't your position I'll just drop it as that's all I wanted to talk about.

As for the Japan thing. I don't really think this is the place to debate history but the whole wary of Stalin or the USSR thing is kinda the point. I mean the US basically let a lot of war criminals off scot free just because they could be useful against the communists which says a lot about them in my opinion.

Regardless I still think [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RCRTgtpC-Go) video by Shaun is an excellent recounting of the final days of Japan in WW2 and goes into detail on the actors and events during that time. I think it rather conclusively shows that the bombs were not the knockout punch wonder weapon that they have been somewhat hyped up in history as but rather just a continuation of an already existing bombing campaign that did not significantly affect policy.",1,jt5stpq,Avatar,t3_1579nzo,t1_jt5qqrz,1690142035.0
"Vaccines: you say that they have brought us to an overpopulated world where life is unsustainable, I say that overpopulation is just a matter of the amount of resources available. We already can feed our entire world population, it's just a logistical problem that comes from an economic system that seeks profit over the wellbeing of other people and failing states (see many nations in Africa). Getting rid of vaccines as a whole would mean the death of millions and if that's what you want by balance then I must say that we are on opposite sides on this matter.

Genetic engineering: I agree, it's control but control isn't necessarily a bad thing, even less if we are talking about saving our world from ourselves. We have to weight the pros and the cons of this technology as we do with everything in general. Besides, you talk about “enslaving plants and animals” and this is where I fundamentally disagree because, first of all, you can't enslave a plant because it isn't even sentient because it doesn't have a brain, animals on the other hand... Ehhh, it's a case by case scenario because you could argue that dogs and cats domestication was a matter of symbiosis where humans offered the animals shelter and protection in exchange for their aid at either hunting small rodents or helping humans hunt and herd animals while, cows, pigs, chickens and sheeps were mainly domesticated by the food they provided on which case I agree it's crueller but hey, as I mentioned previously, we are already working on way around that such as lab grown meat, more humane deaths for animals, etc.

Who says the Na'Vi won't domesticate their equivalents to sky and sea horses after all?

Industry: most of our pollution comes from the fact that we are currently too inefficient at producing and expending energy, does this mean we should return to monke? No, just means that we need to improve our industrial matrix to a more ecological one. Have you heard of nuclear fusion? I recommend you looking at it as a potential future energy source thousands of times mor efficient.

God: being a God requires one to be atemporal, all powerful and all knowing but when talking about playing about being God, then it's rather subjective because a a K3 civilization (a civilization capable of harness their whole galaxy's energy) would seem like Gods to us, we would also seem like Gods to a group of monkeys (if they had the capacity of making and/or understanding that concept) because we can harness most of the world's energy and resources, so I disagree, we wouldn't be immortal because you require to be timeless and that requires you to defeat entropy (physically impossible), instead, we would be amortal (you don't die of disease but you can die of a car accident).

"1 it’s not only the vaccines. I mentioned them because you made an example with them. 
The economic system that only seeks for profit is also a problem for me. I mean if you think about that. The more technology or other stuff we have the bigger the hole between rich and poor will be. Death of many may not be what we want but maybe what needs to be. 


2. I think “enslaving” plants and animals was a wrong term from me. I mean that we use Plants and animals as our tools. I mean we treat plants, trees, cows, chickens, pigs, … as if their only reason they live was to serve us and in my opinion this is not the case.

I just don’t think it is our destiny to control on this level. I believe that our place is not in the skys but in the dirt (if you understand what I mean).

You mentioned right the principle of symbiosis. Living together with advantages on both sides. And yes you can see this also by the Na’vi.

I don’t really get your domesticate point with the Na’vi. I don’t know if it’s my English but I don’t understand the sentence quite.

3. Oh yes I know about nuclear fusion. But look even if we get that to work where will the recourses (especially the deuterium and Tritium or He3) come from. This means we need to “steal”/gather even more recourses which means more taking without giving and more disbalance.


4. I used the term “playing god” because we try to control and manipulate other life. Not because of immortality. I just see that all this advancing to now and to the future is only for having control. But it is an illusion 


Something more personal:
You know I hate the saying “do whatever you want because nobody cares”. I hate it because it’s true. I walk around in cities these days and everyone is just passing by and nobody really cares for each other. You see greed for having money and for power everywhere which both are useless by the end of the day. 
Objects should be used and people should be loved but many times you see that objects (money, power, having, control) are loved and people or other life are being used. And then you see the Na’vi where everyone cares for each other, there is no greed, they don’t only work for themselves and intimacy and love have such a meaning that their kind of marriage lasts for a lifetime. Then I look back and think “this could also be us” but not if let ourself fall deeper into that spiral of never having enough. Maybe and only maybe this could be us if would be ok with our place in the dirt, ok with not having control over everything, ok that not the entire universe is about us and that we grow or that we feel comfortable and let go of the urge to have control, let go the urge of having power and letting go of the greed.

"We seem to agree that the current system isn't by far the best out there, where we seem to disagree with is the control over resources. You seem to have a problem with controlling and exploiting resources, even in space, isn't that right? Meanwhile, I don't think that's the problem, the problem is when we damage the earth's enviroment while extracting resources. Surely, at least imo, nobody would have a problem if we started extracting resources from asteroids or the moon *(well, perhaps the moon a little bit because of it's historical importance, but at least not any outposts or mines in the dark side of it as they can't be seen)* for things like fusion fuel (it's believed tritium could exist in abundance up there although we already use lithium anyway), or rare earth resources *(which require highly contaminant processes to extract)*.

Another point where we seem to disagree is on the gen engineering part. I don't think it's bad as long as we don't abuse of it with sentient and sapient beings so things like using plants in our favour and lab grown meat is alright as we aren't hurting or exploiting nothing that really has a brain. Human gen modding and uplifting animals to human level intelligence on the other hand... That might very well be worth it's own separate discussion.

They all are an important part of their ecosystem. Everyone does his job so there is some kind of circle. If we change what and how their metabolism produces or works there could be consequences.


In my opinion: technologically yes. But what we could and should advance is our mindset. We would need to let go of greed and owning objects or power. We should care about others and be more connected. Lern and accept that bad things happen as randomly as the good things.

Not saying Avatar is a terrible script, but for someone like Sam Worthington or Stephan Lang or the dude who played Tsu'tey (sic), who have a broad acting range, it is a shame that Avatar didn't utilize their talent. But, Sam has time to become big; for one, he is in a Marvel movie coming out (don't hold me to this, I think he is.)",3,juxx7yj,Avatar,t3_15i6nt2,t3_15i6nt2,1691266441.0

"Sam Worthington is not a great actor, he’s an okay actor. A great actor is able to do accents properly, especially an American accent if you’re going to be starring in Hollywood movies. His American accent sucks, I constantly hear it slip up when I watch Avatar, one sentence he pronounces an “ER” word with a hard R like an American, the next sentence he pronounces it with a soft R like an Australian, he has no consistency. It’s not just Rs either, he constantly slips up with other stuff like vowels too. As an Australian who’s really interested in accents I have a strong ear for it so I notice it a lot. 

The fact that James Cameron picked a guy who can’t even do an American accent properly for his biggest Hollywood film is baffling to me. He even got Hollywood celebrity vocal training and he still constantly slips up. Asides from the accent thing he’s a semi-decent actor, but he’s nothing special, I don’t think he deserved the role in Avatar, there were far better actors to choose from.

So I think the reason you don’t see him in much other stuff is because he’s not the best actor, other directors can see he’s not at the level of starring in Hollywood movies. I don’t know why James Cameron didn’t see that.",3,juufeis,Avatar,t3_15i6nt2,t1_jusnt9a,1691201012.0

And sure, different camera focal lengths and angles and all but assuming average adult male and female heights stay consistent with current growth rates and global averages, by EYE it still looks like we’re seeing avatars and Navi who should be at least twice that length

Saying then that they’re 9 ft tall doesn’t seem to track with what we know that looks like next to a man

Again, there seems to be at least a foot height of disparity which is consistent with the OPs chart at least

I don’t think they’ve actually been scaled down any, I just think that new “lore” number was changed and now it doesn’t make sense

I mean lore is all useless anyway - it’s all subject to change - but saying they’re actually 9 feet and always have been simply doesn’t track",6,jsd8zg2,Avatar,t3_152b0vi,t1_jsd7lda,1689626502.0

3. The technology was developed by RDA on Pandora, and the instructions and/or materials for creating it hadn’t gotten back to earth yet.

"Haha, I think I read somewhere that humans have the largest penises of all mammals proportionately to their body size.  It came to be this way because we have artificially selected this to be the case.  Women over countless generations have for one reason or another developed a preference for large genitalia and were more likely to mate with those males who were more endowed and as a result those particular males were more likely to pass on their genes 🧬 to offspring.  Enough time passes and a kind of feedback loop 🔂 happens and human male penises keep getting bigger and bigger.

Kind of like when puppy breeders try to develop “tea-cup” chihuahuas.  They pick out the smallest pups to breed with other small pups, which creates even smaller pups.  And enough time passes and that which was at one time a wolf is now able to fit into a tea cup. (Even though the breeder  didn’t start with a wolf, natural selection got it from a wolf to a large chihuahua). 🐶☕️😝

Exactly. That’s also what’s going on with birds. Songbirds have 3-4 times more neuron per square centimetre than the average mammal and therefore more efficient and fast brains. That’s also why some corvids such as New Caledonian crows or ravens rival great apes with a brain the size of a walnut.

"Decomposition is a complex process involving many different organisms.

My guess is that because Pandora is a completely alien world.  The aforementioned organisms that aid in breaking down bodies on Earth might not go after human bodies as efficiently or at all.  While internal bacteria and chemicals do also aid in decomposition, it’s not the whole story.

Then you get into factors like soil composition, acidity, water, humidity, oxygen, all that.  Look up bog bodies, some of them are thousands of years old and are remarkably intact.",85,ksr3z54,Avatar,t3_1b39sff,t1_ksqv5ah,1709240460.0
"Actually did my research on this now. 
1. Pandora is a rain forest and very humid. This will slow down the process a lot due to the soil being wetter.
2. Oxygen plays a big part in decomposing. There's not much of that on Pandora, especially not 6 feet under. The Navi also don't bury their dead in coffins (that are like an air/oxygen bubble) instead puttin them directly into the soil.

So while it's safe to say that at some point all bodys on pandora will decompose (as it happened to Quaritchs human body in A1) it will take a lot more time.",136,ksr0fjd,Avatar,t3_1b39sff,t1_ksqv5ah,1709239316.0

I always asked myself the second question too, but even if it was just a vegetative state like the Avatars are if they aren't linked at first, Neytiri took his mask off while he was going through the eye of Eywa. He' also burried without one. Without air the body will die, which is why they keep Graces Avatar in the amino-tank too. So Yeah, it's dead.

"I think it's also just another way to grief. Some people cry and wail loudly, some cry quietly and some just get so numb that they could barely cry or emote at all.

Losing a loved one is a very sudden and shocking experience. One moment they are there with you and the next second they' no longer exist in your life. Sometime we look at the dead body of our loved one and secretly hope that they are just sleeping and you expect to talk to them again tomorrow. But it never happened.

Jack certainly did not enjoy living in his crippled human body, and of course he'd be eager to move on in his new, more capable Navi body. But just like when we finally left a childhood home that we have dwelled in for so long, you cant help but feel the grief and loss of the very essence of you that remained in that old house.

"There are a lot of headcanons/fanfictions about this. I think they simply grew apart. Jake was in the marines and shipping out regularly, Tommy was doing Avatar training for mere years and got himself a doctorate, just like Norm (who had 500+ hours link time alone).  
With siblings close in age (especially twins) it's always a bit of rivalry anyways. The few times that Jake does talk about him in the movies/comics it always feels like he thinks he could never live up to him. (e. g. ""Tommy was the smart one, \[...\] me I was just another dumb grunt getting send some place he was going to regret""), which would rise tension as well.

"I have sat in a inservice Apache cockpit and I have seen the bullet proof glass, if a 50cal couldn’t get through I highly doubt an arrow could. The main issue is the fact that the helicopters are just letting the Navi pull this stupid shit. Apaches can do 227 mph, and the scorpion can do 160mph, which is not desirable but more than enough to easily out run ikran. Most gun-cam footage you can find on YouTube is extremely compressed and a result of digitization/ regular compression. If you have ever seen unedited live infrared footage then you know that it is shockingly clear, in 2160 I would imagine they could probably see beyond the horizon with ease. So why would the helicopters be so close? Hellfires in our timeline can be guided to targets miles away, imagine what it would be in theirs. The whole electric jamming thing doesn’t make sense either, TOW or infrared guided missiles would not be effected. Real helicopter pilots would never be caught stupid like these idiots, countering them is extremely easy, use radar to know when they approach, and from there use radar guided missiles to take them out. The final battle from avatar1 also makes little strategic sense. Why did quaritch not send a forward recon force? Did the Recon marine forget about the importance of foreword observers? Quaritch could have done what Storming Norman did, send foreword observers behind enemy line to tell him of when they leave, get a numbers estimate, etc. Why would the helo pilots start hovering, instead of putting distance between them and the enemy? This mission is a stupid method of frightening the enemy, but could have been executed much better, imagine you are John Navi walking around when boom, missiles faster then you can see hitting all around you, the tree is gone and the enemy is no where in sight, and then they appear from behind the sky, revealing they were watching you the whole time.

"Tl;dr: Na'vi bows and human guns, while similar, are different tools for different scenarios. Each excels in some areas but is less effective in others. Both remain viable weapons in combat. 

It takes very specialized and/or powerful firearms to take down large Earth fauna with any kind of ease. An elephant is capable of surviving an entire magazine dump from a kalashnikov(for a short while, at least, not sure about long term), and elephants aren't even particularly well armoured.  To kill one with a single shot requires both extreme accuracy and an extremely large, fast, and usually expanding bullet. Most military grade ammunition is non-expanding steel core FMJ, which are designed for penetration and accuracy over damage. They are easily survivable(see those elephants I mentioned earlier) and are, in fact, illegal for use in hunting in most places. The weapons themselves are designed for accurate, sustained fire in target rich areas. The goal of a hit from these weapons is to incapacitate, if not kill. 

Pandoran fauna are larger and more aggressive than earth animals on average, as well as being more heavily armoured. For them, an animal needs to go from unaware to dead as quickly as possible before it can do any damage. It tracks that Na'vi tech in the archery department would be forced to evolve ways to deal with these problems. Their arrows are long with sharp points for penetration, along with heavily serrated arrowheads for maximum damage. We also see the Na'vi employ novel archery techniques that would help with this. There are several scenes where we see a hunter go into a steep dive before launching an arrow, which should, in theory, impart even more potential kinetic energy into the arrow. I imagine that an arrow from a human compound bow could probably break through an aircraft windshield since they have to sacrifice density and, therefore, strength for weight. A 7 foot long Na'vi arrow traveling in excess of 200MPH(Conservative estimate) should have no issue passing through.",2,j2xsymg,Avatar,t3_102oz8r,t3_102oz8r,1672856622.0

The Samson isn’t a combat vehicle, it’s built for transport and the scorpion is made to counter missiles and rocket weapons

Neither really requires armoured windows, and we know the Samson’s windows break by rifle fire so anti-projectile material wasn’t considered (probably through underestimating the capability of the na’vi)

In the second film, they use one arrow fired from the back of a diving banshee which has to carry at least the force of a full grown man and we see them actively stealing anti-aircraft rocket weapons to use so either missiles too got upgrades like the aircraft or neither have speculative powers and both are just expendable 

Thing is, overwhelming force is how the humans view their capabilities, so when they are heavily outnumbered (two helicopters against like 30 warriors) there is no hope, especially when they have guns too now.

Most of what we see on pandora is made from stuff on pandora, only wiring and chips and other more complex things are flown in and then assembled on site

To mitigate the explosion (and make materials more recoverable) would mean that you need to remove most munitions form the Sampson which makes it a lot less effective 

So a defence system could probably protect against arrows (assuming the system actually detects arrows as threats worth shooting) would make the Sampson a lot less combat effective

i thought about that too but it would be incredibly hard to pull off.

"It would be accurate to describe James Cameron’s long-awaited sci-fi sequel Avatar: The Way Of Water as, well, as whale of a time at the cinema – and it’s rarely more visually resplendent than when pointing its (largely virtual) lens at Payakan. The majestic, colossal ‘Tulkun’ who befriends Jake and Neytiri’s son Lo’ak has become a firm fan favourite – not only garnering sympathy for his tragic backstory, but kicking some serious Recom ass in the final reel too. He even gets his own ultra-hissable baddie, Brendan Cowell’s Mick Scoresby, through the course of the film – a hunter who’s made a trade of selling life-extending Tulkun brain-goo for major financial gain. The good news for Avatar fans is, there’ll be more Payakan to come in the upcoming Avatar 3. According to producer Jon Landau, he’ll be back – and acting in a deeper capacity than in Way Of Water. “We view Payakan as a character, not just as a creature,” he tells Empire. “We will continue to explore his relationship with Lo’ak.” Spelling more trouble, though, is the confirmation that Scoresby will be returning too – likely even more dangerous than before, since Payakan caused him to lose an arm in The Way Of Water’s action-packed finale.

If Cameron’s sequel made anything clear, with the introduction of Edie Falco’s General Ardmore as the leader of the RDA, it’s that the war for Pandora is far from over. “Way Of Water was Quaritch’s vendetta but Ardmore’s, or the RDA’s, goals have not changed,” confirms Landau.

"They had an advantage in the water, plus they couldn’t attack the main human city without massive losses for the Na’vi.

"Well if I remember correctly, the RDA brought pretty much an army with them to Pandora this time around. I think it’s safe to assume that they have a much bigger force compared to the first movie. So yes the Na’vi have guns and rockets, but the RDA probably have at least a thousand Marines now, hundreds of AMP suits, tons of gunships, etc. They have also built weapons on the planet, like the giant bridge city turrets, which shows they can manufacture more weapons. 

That being said, I think Jake would have to rally all the Na’vi clans just to have enough numbers just to attempt an attack on Bridgecity. (Which might be where we’re heading idk).",124,j6u9s4r,Avatar,t3_10r6n38,t3_10r6n38,1675291641.0

"To be fair, in the water it was one single whaling boat, they didn’t have a chance of losing whatsoever, but on land, he’d have to lead his forces against an entire city filled with turrets and soldiers that could rip them to shreds.

"As folks are saying, it was the entire tribe plus Payakan against one whaling vessel and they still suffered a lot of losses, including one of Jake’s kids.

The only time we see the Na’vi go head to head against the full might of the RDA is the ending of the first film.  Which ended with the ground forces being absolutely butchered and the only reason they won was because of the flux vortex and Eywa sending in hordes of Pandoran wildlife.

A direct attack on Bridgehead would be an utter massacre.  Crossing 2 kilometres of barren no mans land with those big fuckoff guns on the perimeter wall.  Not gonna work.  At best they might be able to lay a ye olde siege, and hope they can down any incoming supply shuttles, assuming Bridgehead isn’t already self sufficient.",18,j6uj2jc,Avatar,t3_10r6n38,t3_10r6n38,1675295466.0

"Also I think he got to the point of being forced to fight vs being able to hide. Had he had it his way he would have fled with his family again. I think the whole plot for Jake was the struggle of fight like the warrior I was, or protect and run like the father I am (a dynamic I loved btw). But yea I think in addition to one boat vs the entire RDA, it was also that he had to fight once his kids got kidnapped and were on the boat. He didn’t know he could defeat them before that, nor did he want to know if he could. He really hammers this home in the speech he gives to the Metkayina trying to convince them to not fight. He didn’t want to risk his family’s lives trying to find that out. He was more so afraid that he’d lose all he loved if he did that. (Sadly he needed up losing someone he loved immensely anyway). That’s when he realized he could defeat them and that both running and fighting hold hold equal risk of losing your family-a sort of “damned if I do and damned if I don’t, so might as well do” mentality.",9,j6uc7f0,Avatar,t3_10r6n38,t3_10r6n38,1675292622.0

Well when they arrived they also showed the firepower to practically destroy the entire forest altogether, just by landing on the planet.

I'm surprised that many don't understand that Jake's guerrilla tactics in the beginning were to SURVIVE. They needed gear, AND to cripple parts of the RDA operation, so that if they ever get hunted, they can fight back. 

It's only once Jake realized His Family specifically was being hunted that he came to the conclusion that he needed to leave, because while Neytiri and him might survive being hunted, the children won't.",3,j6vadul,Avatar,t3_10r6n38,t3_10r6n38,1675307524.0

"The RDA doesn't want to kill all Na'vi. We don't hear about it in the movies a lot, but there is some amount of information going back to Earth about what the RDA is doing on Pandora, and Na'vi genocide would probably not go over well. In the first movie the humans wanted them away from valuable mining targets, and in Avatar 2, the RDA is preparing human settlements on Pandora, as ""Earth is dying"". Their current goal seems to be to control as much about Pandora as they can, so that some select humans can come live there permanently (I think... or with the success of the Recom program, more likely have humans come live on Pandora in Na'vi bodies). So Jake's logic was that with him gone from the forest tribe, they would no longer be in danger, as the Na'vi themselves are not currently the RDA's target, it's currently just Jake. They want him out of the picture so bad presumably because of how he has proven to be very good at inciting a resistance to human expansion among the Na'vi, where the Na'vi on their own are either less aware of how to tactically respond to human aggression, or are otherwise pacifists.",21,j6uodud,Avatar,t3_10r6n38,t1_j6um5ag,1675297738.0

"Tbf in both movies, the humans tried to do things peacefully. The issue is what they considered peaceful doesn't always come off that way or they are too impatient for results they want.

In the first movie, they tried to offer things that the Navi didn't care for or want (medicine, roads, education, etc) because they held a bias that they viewed the Navi as savages and weren't invested in Pandora long term, only wanting the resources. In this case, had they been more patient and actually sat down with the tribes and come with compromise in where they could dig/where they couldn't, I would assume the Navi would've held their tongue to some degree. (Remember that they already were mining but they wanted the biggest source of the mineral, which was the tree). It also didn't help that they didn't hold the private military members in check and their violent actions threaten the lukewarm peace established.


The second one is different. Because Earth is pretty much dead from the lore, they have to colonize Pandora, but unlike the first movie, they need to establish good connections with the Navi or the least sooth the actions that the first movie left behind. They can't have Navi killing innocent civilians, but Navi like Jake and Neytiri also don't trust the humans to fully keep to their side (as seen in the first movie) so they have to instigate incidents to keep them in check. 

Had the RDA been patient and again, try to open communications with both Jake and the tribes, and been open on what they were doing/planning, then most likely they could've used that as a building block for diplomacy. But we also know the Navi harbor distrust towards humans because of the everything from the first movie (and the Navi special forces burning villages to the ground did not help relieve tensions, probably made things worse). Also didn't help that they didn't regulate any hunting/resource collecting, leading to them stepping on a lot of toes in their disregard for the bonds formed by the Navi.


ETA: Realistically, for things to get any better between the Navi and Humans would require probably decades of communication, diplomacy, and actual strict regulation.

"Realistically? No. Humans throughout history aren't even kind to our own kind, thinking we are savages just because of skin color or whatever we use to think of ourselves as better.

But is it possible? Yes. Jake isn't even important. This moment of breaking would've happened at some point, but at the time, the humans would've had a better chance of winning because of different factors. Jake just happened to side with the Navi and get them to take the situation more seriously.


Again, this situation is complex to fully predict what would happen. Humans and corporations generally don't try to commit war crimes because it's expensive (in human lives and resources). Hell the corporate side in the first movie didn't even advocate for violence, they just wanted the material with the least amount of suffering for both sides but didn't care about the loss of their homes (even though it was for specs of looking like the good guys), whereas the military faction wanted to use force to get what they wanted.",1,j6zidmh,Avatar,t3_10r6n38,t1_j6zd51n,1675382535.0

"Someone brought up her willingness to kill him but I don't think that's where the fear aspect comes in. 

Like the scene prior with Neytiri has her going HAM on humans and faux na'vi alike. She is full grief rage mama mode. On one hand the bulk of Neytiri in this movie and even in the first one has her disposition set to calm when downtime is a thing. And Kiri and Spider have never been in combat while Neteyam and Lo'ak have only been on the outskirts. Add in that Neytiri seems to defer to Jake whenever it comes to discipline or addressing the children, so she's probably not ever turned mad face on them. And if she has its not quite so violent. 

And I mean, sure, Spider knows what his bio father did so he probably knows Neytiri is capable of killing. All the na'vi are. But it's one thing to hear stories of war and fighting. Totally different to see it up close. Because Spider seems to operate on kid logic. There are heroes and villains. His dad was a villain,  Jake is a hero. That comes with its own expectations. 

Neytiris savageness, her grief, it isn't a triumphant hero but grief. It's not this glorious kick butt moment he probably expected to see. It's rage and loss and a merciless side he's probably never witnessed from na'vi before. I think that's where the fear initially comes from.  Having a knife to his throat doesn't help either because he's seen how she just went through her enemies. He knows he matters little to her already, only tolerated because kiri especially adores him. Without Kiri, there's no reason for Neytiri to keep him alive.",45,jp23bl6,Avatar,t3_14frjv3,t1_jp1wzgi,1687411347.0

"Imo: I don't think Neytiri has many fuzzy feelings for Spider, but I don't entirely think she wanted to kill him more than just show that she was serious enough about hurting him to save Kiri, and this was a length she went to easily. 

She seems to be fine with hurting Spider to protect her daughter, even if she doesn't have a wish to actively end his life, though his convenience as a bargaining chip is probably what kept him alive. And there I think is probably the distinction that she didn't want to kill him like she probably wanted to kill the others, but that was she was willing to if it meant having to choose. 

Spider undeniably forms a bond with someone who was once his father in some form, and who demonstrates more of an interest in his person and safety than either of the adults he spent time around did - even if it was initially a means to an end. Despite his anger, I think Spider seeks in Quaritch what he didn't receive from his father when he was still human. And in turn, I think Q feels something paternal for Spider, and in the wake of that forming bond, shows moments of introspection/contemplation that don't seem as characteristic of the old him. 

And yet - understandably - he still desperately wants to be a part of the community he grew up with. He wants to be one of the Na'vi/Omatikaya, and sees family in the four Sully children. Even though Ney's lack of maternal love and strict tolerance for him demonstrates that he may never fully be a 'part' of that group, it's where much of his identity lies, and in addition to the resentment he already has for his father is what trumps his decision to go with him.",5,jp4oa91,Avatar,t3_14frjv3,t1_jp1xn33,1687461671.0

"The taboo against a large age difference (past the point of physical maturity of course) isn't regarding age by itself, but age being associated with a difference in power.

It makes you wonder if the computing power of Eywa is so immense that she predicted possible futures where it would occur and decided something needed to be done about it before it ever even happened, or if the Na'vi did at one point technologically advance and something bad happened.

"I wrote a comment on my personal theory on Eywa because of these laws a bit ago. Basically;

My theory is that there was an advanced civilisation before the current Na’vi population today, that ultimately destroyed themselves with their tech and whatever problems those brought. So they made a supercomputer that spans all over the planet, with exposed parts coming up in the form of various flora that their descendants could connect to, to stay more connected to nature unlike their brutal ancestors. They didn’t upload too much about themselves so that their descendants couldn’t rediscover their technology through Eywa’s memory, all they uploaded to it before they dipped (or just went extinct) was those three laws, things that most civilisations would eventually discover on their own, so they made sure that it was ‘illegal’ to do so. 

Also related to my theory; the current Na’vi were genetically altered by their advanced ancestors before they were ‘set loose’ on the newly healed Pandora, which could be why they look so *odd* compared to most other animals on Pandora (i have no explanation for the Prolemuris though, again, just my fun theory thats probably wrong) if you know Horizon Zero Dawn, i imagine thats kinda how they’d be reintroduced to the planet, long after all the old tech could break down and all trace of their brutal past was gone.",39,jmwmgh3,Avatar,t3_140gm1a,t3_140gm1a,1685910907.0
Maybe eywa has a past that’s just like avatar earth and learnt from its mistake so instead of having competitive environment like earth does which would make a singular species emerge to be dominant and intelligent enough to the point of destroying the planet she decided she would be the most intelligent and if a species like humans did develop the world should cater to their needs so they wouldn’t have the need to create tools and eventually industry. And she has them live in harmony with other animals and her by developing this planetary nervous system so they have unity.,22,jmwitx4,Avatar,t3_140gm1a,t3_140gm1a,1685909364.0

Either this or the Na'vi were beginning to hurt the Great Balance themselves by digging up metals, using car like vehicles and killing indiscriminately.

Eywa then made a plan to stop the advancement of their technology. Either allowing the Great Balance to be disrupted causing a time of Great Sorrow or warning them of the cost of their actions and giving them the option of giving it up.
She then gave them her laws and scattered them throughout the Moon so that they wouldn't grow to many or too ambitious. Then after learning of Gaia's death, she reinforced the idea of the Laws being broken causing destruction or great evil, this may be when all the people with knowledge of the tech as well as Eywa, prevented any memory of it being left. With Eywa reclaiming her territory, like nature does. Restoring the balance.",7,jn0ctia,Avatar,t3_140gm1a,t1_jmwmgh3,1685984223.0

"Most of it is memes. 

However I think there are people that mistakenly equate the RDA’s wants with humanity‘s needs, and have bought the propaganda that Avatar is about humanity and the Na’vi fighting to the death for survival, when really it’s about the RDA using humanity’s survival as a false justification to make more profit.",250,jt0z0iz,Avatar,t3_156n8b0,t3_156n8b0,1690050255.0
"I think for a lot of people it is just memes, but could also be a case that they just root for humans in general, rather than looking deeper into the meaning or connotations behind it. 

Warhammer, Starship Troopers, Halo, all have a focus of rooting for a military force in an asymmetrical warfare setting. Some people just get fixated on supporting the humans regardless of how corrupt and evil their cause is.

Referring back to my examples, none of the human factions are shining examples of a faction worth supporting, the Imperium are not great for a lot of reasons, the Federation in starship troopers are a very strict government with a lot of corporal punishment, the UNSC has the whole kidnapping, insurrection etc... Yet a lot of people support them or see them as the good guys simply because they are humans fighting against something that isn't.

&#x200B;

So it is no surprise that there are people who have gotten caught up in supporting those sort of factions so much that they immediately recognise the human faction as the heroes of the story.

As for me, I don't agree with the RDA as a faction, but I do like their technology, the mech suits and dropships are pretty cool.",36,jt19djp,Avatar,t3_156n8b0,t3_156n8b0,1690054830.0

"Some people do it for the meme, some people do it because they think their technology is cool (which is true, to be fair) and some people do it because they've bought into the propaganda, or are a bit.. morally questionable.

A lot of supporters seem to think that the RDA is on Pandora to gather crucial resources that are necessary for Earth's continued survival - this is false. The RDA is a non-governmental corporate entity with a vested interest in unobtanium - they use it to power their Earth-side maglev networks, and have exclusive rights to its mining, selling the excess to the highest bidders. They're on Pandora to make a profit and protect their own interests, not to save humanity from a dying world. It's akin to oil companies today, or how Europe exploited the people and resources of Africa for their own economic gain.",17,jt1eea4,Avatar,t3_156n8b0,t3_156n8b0,1690057043.0

Some people genuinely enjoy the technology or aesthetic of the rda, they are marketed as toys after all and so were designed to look cool. 
 
On the other hand this video and other memes like it are often used by people to support fascist ideals without appearing like they are. Every fan base has the people that support the villains in more than just they look cool. Star Wars is another fan base where this problem arises. 

While it’s hard to know the true intentions of the author without being in the author’s head, it’s hard to say “memes” like this aren’t being used as an easy cover to support fascism.

Thats probably a result of the amazing final battle scene from Avatar 1   


2: i know RDA doesnt care about Humanity´s Survival , but something just annoys me that the first movie makes all humans look bad(except jakes ""crew"") , i mean its little things for me like in the second half of the Final battle , when na´vi are getting pushed back the sad music hits but that probably 90 percent of the human soldiers die then its just like "" yeah bad Humans , they derseved it"". and i dont like to betray my species

"There are three main  tangents of RDA support in the avatar Franchise.

1. Gary: Likes the technology and mechs of the RDA, Gary hates the RDA,  Gary is an RDA “supporter” but understands the RDA is evil and will easily and simply say: “Fuck the RDA”  when asked without starting  frothing at the mouth while maniacally repeating  “Humanity first!/ Purge  Xenos/ Or sone vaguely Latin phrases “ Gary is cool be like Gary 

2.The Fash path: People who are unironic facist, who hate the messages of ecology, peace and harmony that the Movies have, alongside  online edgelords, Military simps  and other people who either hate the movie, hate its messages or just like to be imperialist “ironically”

This guys are dicks.


3.The “usefool”: This guy saw generations films video on Avatar( no hate to those guys, but their videos on avatar are awful) this guy actively believes the Humans tried a peaceful route(They didn’t), these guy really believes there is a secret message beyond protect nature( There isn’t)
This guy believes humanity somehow needs to genocide and destroy to survive( They don’t) this guy is misguided and has fallen for circular logic and 18th century arguments. In this pillar also fall the military sci-fi fans who think all stories with a human military figthing aliens must have humanity as the good guys.

Those are the three pillars of RDA support.

The chill one, the deranged one and the misguided one.

"I’ve just been recommended this post and I first want to say I’m not the biggest fan of avatar but I actually have some opinions on this so I thought I’d post. The way I understand the avatar lore I’d say overall yes I do support the humans. The way I understand it is: Earth is dying and we need the special Mcguffin space metal to help move people off earth, and the whales have a substance in them that can basically cure most anything or slow aging significantly, I forget which it is.  The blue guys aren’t really receptive to negotiating and the corpos from earth really only see dollar signs, so pressed for time with a mix of poor management and an increasingly aggressive local population violence escalates beyond the point of no return for both parties. Do I think the corpos should have this much involvement in the matter? No, but they’re doing the mining so it is what it is until a better solution could be found. Do I think that a peaceful resolution was the preferred outcome? Yeah of course. Ultimately the survival of the human race is at stake so if you gotta blow up a big tree and kill some aliens then tough luck but thats exactly what I’m doing.

"I support the humans in the first Avatar, not the second. At least not for the most part. There’s a few good videos on the subject, but humans low key may not be the good guys but definitely justifiable.

Humanity is dying. They need the stuff under the tree so they can colonize more planets for resources like food and energy. The humans even tried to peacefully trade the Navi for the tree, and Sully was sent specifically to find out what the Navi want in exchange for leaving the tree. Hell if I recall, the humans tried to gas them non-lethally and only used fire a bit later on the tree.

So I guess the question is, one Navi clan living at the tree, or billions of humans? I know what I’d pick.

Also I know people are talking about the company. But I mean, what they’re doing is still going to save humanity, whether the higher ups have a alternative motive or not, and they again, tried to do it peacefully.",0,jt16zom,Avatar,t3_156n8b0,t3_156n8b0,1690053779.0

I wish the Avatar movies were more balanced instead of just humans bad Navi good. They should have focused more on humanity needing the resources on Pandora to survive and the Navi not willing to negotiate and advance as a species with the humans' help. The Navi also should have been shown to have flaws instead of being depicted as pure good and in sync with nature. If that was the case then the plot could be nuanced and the audience could debate which side is in the right. On the one hand humanity is trying to progress and advance as a species while on the other hand the Navi are trying to defend their traditional ways. If that was the case I would support the humans but with how it is I think the question is kind of irrelevant since humans are only shown as bad and Navi are only shown as good.,-2,jt19qkz,Avatar,t3_156n8b0,t3_156n8b0,1690054989.0

They pursue greed and disregard the rest of the world. The invading humans are working for the very same people who wrecked the Earth to do it again on another world.

Obviously being a refugee and being an invader are two completely different things. By moving to another country, you don't destroy that country, even if you don't blend in. There are still humans who stayed behind on Pandora without enfolding into the Navi. They wear human clothes, speak English, and some don't seem to believe in Eywa. 

As for why there are people out there defending the invading humans, my only guess is that they want to implant the idea that seeking refuge is an invasive act or that civilization is a free-for-all race war.

I mean the movies pretty unambiguously frame the humans as evil and showcase it many times. If you really can't see that they are evil after they attack and murder innocent people for profit then I don't know what to tell you.,1,jt43g7o,Avatar,t3_156n8b0,t1_jt3dfmp,1690115057.0
"we need pandora to survive? hmmm why would that be. Maybe because stupid corporations like the RDA are destroying the  planet. The RDA wants to save humanity? Stop mining, deforesting and polluting the earth and maybe we wouldn't need another planet to survive. The reason humanity needs another planet is because they fucked up their own. Why should the na'vi have to pay for the mistakes of humanity? 

The na'vi were also fine with humans on the planet. They were eager to learn English, as shown in the extended cut of Avatar 1. What reason have humans given the Na'vi to like them? We come to their home, ravage their resources  and take them to earth, burn down their homes and sacred places and kill them just because (humans literally brought a school shooting to Pandora). The humans in the movie are positioned as so comically bad that it's insane people even side with them.

The na'vi only hate humanity because humans have given them an uncountable amount of reasons to do so.",6,jt298yj,Avatar,t3_156n8b0,t1_jt1hyvj,1690071239.0

"The RDA didn’t try to talk with the Na’vi, they just set and ultimatum from the start: Abandon your way of life and let us access to your resources, and we will give you “civilization”. Tha same civilization that makes humanity face extinction and creates the need for Pandora’s resources. 
The fact that Grace and Jake were allowed to establish negotiations was just a way to increase profit by trying to reduce the cost of driving the Na’vi out it their homes, as well as to gain intel on them. If you read between the lines, you can see it never was about peace talks, Jake was sent to convince them to abandon the Hometree, but the first thing they ask him when coming isn’t how the talks went, it’s the internal structure, possible fortifications, weak points, etc of the structure of the Hometree.",3,jt3hnek,Avatar,t3_156n8b0,t1_jt2xv7l,1690098608.0

"Realistically, any species operating on the dark forest is unlikely to detect a civilization cuz the whole hypothesis assumes that civilizations live close enough to detect each other. Intelligent life (let alone a civilization) is a million times rarer than the existence of life itself. So a dozen of civilizations within a 100 light year radius is improbable, even too absurd to consider. 

The Na'Vi's lifestyle is so primitive and cosmically quiet that they're indistinguishable from animals. They're simply too quiet to detect. 

Even if they were an advanced civilization, violence is still not an option. The fact that the discoveries in the 13th century are negligible compared to the discoveries in the 20th century proves that technological advancement is accelerating. There's a real chance they would be very powerful by the time your armies and weapons reach them. 

Also, wouldn't attacking expose your location to them and other civilizations? Why would violence be the only choice if it's the loudest thing you could do?",1,jt225tc,Avatar,t3_156n8b0,t1_jt1ruh6,1690067776.0

And This situation will only end in 2 ways.... Human Na'a'vi cooperation and colonization of pandora or annihilation of the Na'a'vi.

  NOW BEFORE YOU GET YOUR PITCHFORKS AND DOWNVOTE ME TO OBLIVION LET ME EXPLAIN WHY:

Movie Reason:  leaked plot says Jake and fam go take a trip to earth with UN officials to show the human perspective and then most probably there will be some plot bs where either 1. Eywa heals the Earth or 2. Gaia our version of Eywa awakens and heals the Earth..... And everyone lives happily ever after (also Cameron gets to make a lot more movies)

Realistic reason : If humankind really needs pandora so much then they will just orbital strike the damn planet to oblivion and back just so they can mine some shiny space rocks ..... And they would have my full support cuz MY species may be bad.... But at the end of the day they are MY species..... Doesn't mean that I support the RDA though....

Jake was right to position the na'vi to force the colonisers off of Pandora. He knew what happened to earth and he didn't want the humans to move earth's problems to Pandora.

Also, I'm certain the Na'vi already knew why humans were on Pandora. It's probably one of the first questions they asked when meeting humans.

"Whether or not either species deserves to die isn't my point.

My point is that the humans *don't deserve or have the right* to genocide and steal from the navi, regardless of whatever situation humanity/earth is in. 

If you fail to pay your mortgage and lose your house, is it okay to squat and steal someone else's? No, because that's fucking dumb.

The humans are 100% the bad guys. It doesn't matter if humanity is on the edge of extinction. That *does not* justify their actions, especially as the situation they're in is of their own doing.

Individual people may not be evil, but if the RDA is evil and humanity as a whole supports what they're doing... then humanity is the fucking bad guy. It isn't a complex situation. 

We're individual German people evil during WWII? No, of course not. Plenty of them were on the right side of history.

However, even if you weren't personally antisemitic, if you didn't do anything to counter the Nazis... then you're enabling the Nazis. 

Humanity is 100% the bad guy. It does not matter if they're on the brink of extinction, that does not justify their actions. At all. Just because we have an innate desire and drive to survive, doesn't give us the right to genocide another race and steal their resources. That's such a blatantly poor and dumb argument. 

If you don't pay your mortgage, you can't just squat someone else's house because of your bad decisions.",2,jt46jw0,Avatar,t3_156n8b0,t1_jt2wr0k,1690116808.0
"I think you are forgetting that the RDA is fighting, despite having and enormous technological advantage, in an unknown environment completely hostile to them while also being vastly outnumbered by an enemy capable of moving through that environment effortlessly. Launching a massive attack would be suicidal, because all Na ‘vi clans would unite against them. By infiltrating and studying them, they gain intel, capability to move through the forest easily, etc… They could have easily won the war in the first movie, their mistake was launching an attack to a target that would unite the clans while being to unprepared to fight back.",1,jt8basv,Avatar,t3_156n8b0,t1_jt4yxdr,1690192623.0

It proved that the Na'Vi's death isn't the only way for mankind to survive.
It proved that there's no reason to choose between N and H cuz the question is meaningless. So What are you exactly saying here?

The RDA doesn't care because Pandora's natural resources are too yummy to be left unexploited. If they truly gave a f abt humanity then earth wouldn't be dying in the first place. They want their profit and they don't care how many humans have to die to get them.

Also you exist because we genocided all other hominid species, Survival of the fittest. Our species exists on the foundation of genocide and if it is necessary to save our species , we will do it again and again and again. That's how nature built us. We weren't given some divine guidance. We weren't given the choice to live in harmony. We woke up and found ourselves in a world where everything wanted to kill us. We are the children of Earth forged by the hammer of Death upon the anvil of war in the flames of a million hardships. And we will make our creators proud!!!!!

Bonus point: the Na'a'vi are primitive stone age creatures...just like the Neanderthals.

As a great man once said: you can't pick and choose with mother nature, you either get all of her, or none of her.
So either the Na'a'vi can talk it out like civilized people above their base instincts or it's survival of the fittest, nothing held back.

I do not support the RDA but if it's necessary for Humankind to survive, then I'll genocide a million Zenos. I'll regret it for the rest of my life, yes, but I'll stil do it. For all mankind.

There's also the fact that Spider is the son of the man who took so much and caused her so much trauma, it's not easy for her to watch someone in relationship to Quaritch  play amongst her children.

"There's a scene, deleted, that pops in my head. Tsu'tey is dying and allegedly his braid was cut. So he can't connect to the world anymore. And thus, he wants to die by Jake's hand. Obviously not in the movie BUT it does bring to mind the question of ""with everything so interconnected on Pandora, what happens if you can't connect in?"" And being human, Spider can't.  He's got some ability to run with the Sully kids but is that because he can keep up or because they're including him? What are his chances if the Sullys aren't around? 

I also think it's a mix of finding some peace and closure since most of the humans are off world and she probably minimizes her interaction with those humans allowed to stay. Out of sight, out of mind. Plus Spider isn't trying to interact with the Na'vi as a whole. He's with her kids.

Adding to this, There was a comic story line written in collaboration with James Cameron, which he confirmed is part of the story line. And is seems Spider often took blame for some of their mischief, to keep the siblings from being in trouble one incident included Kiri almost getting killed. Spider was not responsible but he took the blame. This did not help Neytiries bitterness. I think she tends to see Quaritch or at the very least is reminded of him when ever she sees Spider.

It is better for Spider to be with humans so he can have a healthy relationship with himself and healthy goals. 

He will never be enough as a human compared to a Na'Vi. He is always enough amongst others of his kind.

I will say this when my kids were young our house was the one that all the kids from everywhere came to 'play'.  At first it was just the normal things like we had a inground pool, always had food and snacks.  When they became older we had the newest x-box, play station, whatever and the games.  We had a BASEMENT!!!  So there were times when I asked my kids , ""Do your friends have homes to go to and eat, sleep maybe take a bath instead of always here?""  I actually really got so tired of everyday the bunches of kids just showing up (early in mornings) and staying until I said it was time to go home.  I had 4 wildlings of my own without having all the others in the neighborhood constantly.  If I had to go somewhere I did not leave my kids alone and in that I had all the others that tagged along.  Naturally as soon as we were out near a McDonalds then they all were hungry.  Now I am not going to let a kid go hungry but could not even get my own a treat from McDonalds.  What is bad is that I had one mother give me a list of food her kids could and could not eat!  Like I was the chef for her kid.

So in that which I have so much more I could write but the point is maybe she was just sick and tired of him always being around.  Maybe once in a while would have been okay but all the time.

It doesn't have much to do with them having ""demon blood"" at all. Neytiri doesn't really seem to care about that. She just knows that the humans nearly destroyed everything she loved, so she has a very thin tolerance for them.

I think Neytiri’s grudge against spider is mostly due to who his father is rather than the fact that he’s human, that makes more sense to me that way. 

In the high ground comics, this conflicted part of neytiri has been addressed. Jake told her that even if he gave up everything for her, those things, being a marine, are still a part of him. Even Mo’at  her mother told her to not being too reluctant to changes.

It’s probably because she started to adapt to the new technology since some are convenient like the little talking coms but shes still engrained into her culture.

He permanently gave up his human form and adopted his Avatar body full time to live amongst them and their culture.

So Jake definitely would’ve had some sort of conversation with Neytiri about her child. And the alternative was to…. what?

"Assuming Kiri is the result of Eywa induced parthenogenesis, that’s still kind of iffy.  There was even a chance she could’ve been male too.  Parthenogenesis is an absolutely fascinating subject.  It’s a fairly complicated subject, but briefly summarized as:

*The egg cells are haploid cells produced from the ovaries by meiosis. A precursor cell after meiosis produces an ovum and three polar bodies (small byproducts of meiotic division). In sexual reproduction, the polar bodies eventually degenerate. That’s what happens in human egg cells following meiosis. But for other organisms, the ovum may fuse with the polar body such as in the case of automixis parthenogenesis (also called meiotic parthenogenesis) described in the previous section. The egg fuses with the second polar body. Thus, although there is no sperm cell involved in increasing gene diversity, this form of parthenogenesis offers a degree of genetic variation among offspring.*

Which is to say Kiri probably isn’t a 1:1 clone of Grace’s Avatar.  Her genetics would still be a random assortment of the Avatar’s.  However, it is entirely possible that she does have a higher percentage of human DNA than Jake’s biological children.

So I meant that in the Avatar Comic: The Next Shadow we see that the Na'vi is not okey with what the remaining humans do on Pandora. They are still farming resources and use their machines to destroy land (not sacred land though) because they need power in order to live etc. So they are simply continuing their work but not like an asshole anymore + there is no killing or army like before. There is mistrust in the Na'vi and there are a lot of conflicts between humans and them because of these activities. Jake tries to negotiate but it is difficult...and so on.

The plot could then be that some Na'vi scouts discover that the RDA are collecting droves of the seeds from the Tree of Souls, which spark another conflict of cultural and religious significance for the Na'vi.

Rather than just dipping from the Omaticaya in the beginning, the movie could end with the Na'vi ultimately losing, the Omaticaya tribe dying out, and the RDA taking the seeds off-world and back to earth as the few remaining Na'vi flee to take shelter among the Metkayina.

If Tsu'tey had survived the first movie, he could have had a more impactful death, sacrificing himself in a final attempt to stop the RDA dropship from leaving the atmosphere, getting shot and falling through the sky as the cargo bay door slowly closed.

Instead of Jake opening his eyes at the end of each movie, this one could end with Tsu'tey closing his eyes, having just watched the ship flown off into outer space.",14,jo5pil1,Avatar,t3_149ep31,t3_149ep31,1686781446.0

"Amirita doesn't make any sense. Okay they have the stuff, horrible as how they got it..they got it. Why don't they just Clone it? Aside from the obvious immorality of killing a fully sentient and sapient species. Seems far cheaper and safer than hunting Tokun, which will only piss off the Na'vi. By the point of Avatar 2 Pandora as a whole and the Na'vi seemed to have come to a reluctant tolerance of humanity's presence. 

I say that because the Tribes didn't unite a second time to remove Humanity and the 'immune response' seems to be localized to the Hallelujah Mountains. The water Tribes seemed uninterested in pursuing a war so very far away. They knew 'of' the hunting of Tokun but it was an abstract thing do very far away they couldn't do anything about. Now they're enraged.

One would think actively pissing off the locals, who ordinarily wouldn't give a shit about you, and actively making them a problem is not only dumb strategy but now places humanities only refuge in danger.

"I think it has to do with some people, including myself, really hating Avatar to the point of nitpicking every single thing without any reason.

Personally, the reason I hate Avatar is because of how the director decided to depict the fight between the Na'vi and the Humans.

In real life, there is no such thing as completely good or completely bad. granted, there was a small handful of humans that tried to stop RDA but not enough to be considered realistic.

Then there is his whitewashing of the entire Na'vi. I repeat, there is no such thing as completely good and completely bad. But it seems the director fails to grasp this point.

 There is also the fact that he dropped the ball with the second movie. He had such a good opportunityy to explore the exotic world of Pandora and show us just how amazing and beautiful that world is. Instead, he squandered itwithy a repeat of the first movie with a different version of space cats and a different batch of humans.",0,jaiiz4z,Avatar,t3_11eo8ld,t3_11eo8ld,1677694036.0

They have no real way to return to Earth, unless it's as prisoners/traitors/turn-coats, assuming i understood the end of Avatar 1 correctly. They stayed voluntarily, but I'm assuming Earth's governments are pissed about that, because they helped the Na'vi send home the military and all the folks trying to make money, which obviously ""big government"" cares only for that and not so much about the science stuff. 

That said, if I had an Avatar body to be moved into, and the Omatikaya were willing, then yeah, I'd prefer to just... embrace my situation.

"I think the drivers also have to consider that their human bodies *will* degrade over time. It comes with the job and is part of the training.

It's why they generally don't go for longer than 6 years. 6 years of lying still for 8-16 hours a day (then they go to sleep, so lying still for *even longer*) will **fuck up your body** hardcore. 

So, it's being a driver and constantly returning to a body in worse and worse shape, or going through the permanent transition. If they survive the transition, they also have to consider that when their avatar dies, they're dead. At least—as drivers—if their avatar dies, they still have their human body.

"I know the base message of the show is talking about like recources and greed, but it also has a message about military strategy. It shows that even with vast VAST technological superiority, correct and planned tactics are still of utmost importance when it comes to fighting a war. Knowledge of the terrain and geography for which the war is being fought on plays the biggest part. The helicopter pilots fly as though they have complete air superiority, and while it is somewhat true, their incompetence is why they keep getting shot through the windshield of all things. Soldiers in the forest surely cannot expect to win a firefight in a clearing, without cover and even then especially not when it’s the low ground either! During TWOW, while it is true that Neytiri is shown to be an excellent fighter, in the scene with all the recoms in the forest where they all get picked off, they could’ve won it easily by taking cover behind the trees and simply throwing grenades up the hill.

I might not care much for humans, but I love Earth deeply and the idea of being separated from Her and seeing harm done? That's unacceptable to me, and it's human culture that causes that, not Gaia. I'm not going to die in space for some billionaire techbro. I'm going to die here, and be buried in the forest... and if the molecules that make up my body wind up in a bangalow palm then that will be just about perfect. Bangalow palms make me happy too :)

BTW: Neuralink is basically recycled tech from the 1980s. Atari had a similar concept for a video game controller. By the 2000s other teams had evolved it to the point of it being tested as a.... video game controller. The tech hasn't evolved at all since. Implants are used for medical purposes, but it's a world away from Muskian fantasies about uploading knowledge or something. I think Musk just watched The Matrix while high and.... yeah. The way the brain creates memory and behavior (and links to the two) makes it pretty much impossible to just ""upload your brain"".

Will humans survive? I honestly don't really mind either way, as long as their survival does not compromise the wellbeing of Earth. the idea of there being no humans doesn't bother me.",1,jwu1s7z,Avatar,t3_15tmypi,t1_jwtzs2o,1692433289.0

Honestly humanity would probadly have bypassed Pandora as not worth the cost of investment compared to other colonisation options. The only reasons RDA is interested in Pandora is the fact its the only habital planet in range of human ships and unobtainium. The first one is no longer a factor and the sol system in this setting isn't suffering from the resource/energy shortfalls that make unobtainium so valuable (compare to other options) Outside of scientific/anthropological research Pandora would probadly be a backwater with the discovery of sentient alien life its only real impact on the setting.,321,jyzvu64,Avatar,t3_1696s80,t3_1696s80,1693772146.0
"We know that the whole problem with the relationship between humans and na'vi was caused because the first representative of the human race to the na'vi was the RDA. The RDA came to Pandora just for resources and I bet they would have loved that the na'vi didn't existed on that moon. Humanity from Avatar are also in a very precarious position, with their planet going through an ecological disaster and not having good enough interstellar technology to create an interstellar human civilization yet. But, what would happen if it was another humanity that have found Pandora? 

I think that Halo humanity would be a great choice, since they actually were able to put order on the Solar System after the beginning of their interstellar expansion, they are also more advanced and have discovered FTL and they went through some ecological disaster themselves and were able to overcome it. 

The UEG would be way better at handling the situation with the na'vi than the RDA, but they are not perfect themselves. The UEG and UNSC aren't like The Federation from Star Trek, so there would still be a lot of room for conflict with the na'vi. 

For the sake of a more neutral interaction, let's say that the encountered happened during the first century of the human Domus Diaspora so the encounter with The Covenant the still centuries away.

"Little or no conflict.  Pandora remains mostly untouched by humanity.  Relations with the Na'vi are amicable.  There's probably a small human presence on Pandora, mostly scientists and anthropologists.  There might be some tourism.

In the Halo universe, humanity never left the Sol system until the development of the slipspace drive, which opened up hundreds of worlds to colonization.  This began in the year 2362, and over 800 worlds were colonized within 200 years.  These worlds were all human-habitable, either initially or after terraforming.  There would have been no incentive to colonize Pandora.  

The Colonial Administration Authority oversaw the colonization effort, not the UNSC.  At the time the UNSC only operated in the Sol system.  The CAA had their own military branch, the Colonial Military Authority, but they were much smaller and less powerful than the UNSC.  The CAA was an administrative agency, not a military force or a private corporation.

I can't find any mention of Alpha Centauri in the Halo lore, but it probably would have been one of the first systems explored.  

The discovery of sentient life would have been huge news.  It's hard to say how significant the discovery of unobtanium would have been.  Superconductors are a common technology later during the events of the Halo games, and it's not known when they were developed.

"As others said

either bypass it for other worlds that are able to be colonized, like Reach and other planets

or, if the resources are valuable and the Na'vi are hostile and unwilling to allow humans to mine unobtainium, a full-scale invasion would occur

The Na'vi would be defeated decisivly, with humans having Shaw-Fukisawa FTL drives, they can be at Pandora with a week with reinforcements, compare that with six years for a RDA ship. With Ewa (the Pandora intelligence) leading the Na'vi to their deaths. Those remaining Na'vi live with humans in specialized areas and integrated into earth culture. While Pandora is terraformed into a Earth like planet

In the first case the covanant would likely leave Pandora alone or fight the pandorans until either the Pandorans and Pandora are glassed, or the Humans win and the damage depends on when the battle took place (a day or a week)

In the second case, the Covanant would find Pandora through luck (or bad luck), and like every other Human world, glass it to oblivion, which essentially means the majority of any remaining Na'vi are dead, only those on earth are alive

And further to 2, if terraforming does continue after the Human Covenant war ends, the planet would be screwed when Cortana arrives with the Guardians, which shut down technology, meaning if terraforming isn't complete, any human on Pandora will die,

ONI might do some shit, but it would be on such a small scale that it won't really register.

The only ways to make conflict would be an idiot in some high office (a very real possibility) or Pandora being one of the Forerunner experiments/shield worlds, which would immediately make system restricted area and move human actions into Avatar 1 RDA mode (aka ""we do what we want"") backed up by significantly better and more numerous military presence.",1,jz1rqyn,Avatar,t3_1696s80,t3_1696s80,1693800251.0

"Copy and pasting my answer from another post. This is just my opinion of course.

I don’t believe Jake and Neytiri will actually go to Earth. This is the quote from producer Jon Landau

“Well, it’s funny,” Landau said. “I wasn’t going to talk about it, but I’ve now subsequently heard that Jim has talked about it a little bit. In [‘Avatar 5’] there is a section of the story where we go to Earth. And we go to it to open people’s eyes, open Neytiri’s eyes, to what exists on Earth.”

I take it as, we the audience, will get get a better glimpse of the people living on a dying Earth. Part of the plot will likely take place on Earth.

"I suspect that no, Neytiri would actually go to Earth, given the constraints of space travel between Earth and Pandora and Pandora and Earth.

It's much, more more likely Neytiri will see what Earth looks like and what life is like on Earth by way of videos and still photographs.  So

mehow or another, she will realize that there are good people on Earth who are trying to change things for the better.

Neytiri will then realize it is in her best interests and the interests of her people that these good humans get as much help as they can get.

Because if not, the bad humans will keep coming back again and again until they are stopped.  They need to be stopped on Earth, not when they get to Pandora to start their killing.

She and her children (mostly led by Kiri at this point) will then do their best to help the human race to heal itself so there will not be any more ""bad"" humans coming to Pandora to destroy, plunder, and kill.

Thus there will be peace.

Continents and Oceans can been seen in the night sky just as far as we know Pandora hard all the expressive resources, it would be an exerts cost to mine Pandora and settle another moon but that way a trade agreement could be met to end the war. Literally before Falco, the commander before Quarditch (I can’t spell that lol) there were more ethical mining operations going on. It could all be brought back.

Without that alien genetic medium, I don’t think they can grow whole bodies in the same way.

What other planet? It takes almost a decade to reach Alpha Centauri (where Pandora is), the *closest* star system to our own.

A cocodrile once defended a human family from a group of other crocodiles after the human helped him escape a trap. All of this are recorded  real events, Nature can be violent and chaotic as can be selfless and good intentioned.

With the RDA's resources they could EASILY make that sustainable indefinitely.  They could set up an orbital manufacturing facility (or just set it up at Hell's Gate) to make sure that humans would never have to worry about running out of exopacks, or edible food.  Meanwhile they could work on making Avatars cheaper through economy of scale, or bioengineering humans to breathe Pandora's air.

I don't think it was ever said that a language barrier was a major component of ongoing tensions.  They learned to understand each other's languages pretty quickly.  Grace said the Na'vi kids learned English faster than she could teach it.  

> it's never stated what they did when they first came to Pandora

Exactly.  You're making a lot of assumptions to fill that gap, with a huge bias to try and make the RDA look good - contrary to their pattern of behavior that is well-established in the movies and other media.  

> probably set up Hell's Gate at an uninhabited location

That's a big assumption, and it's irrelevant anyway.  It's not the RDA's land.  They had no right to build a massive fortress and open pit mine.  

> the development of the IVS Venture Star strained the company, and it took 6.75 years to get there, they would want to make the most out of a trip like that

So?

>the incident with the hell truck and the Na'vi involved

The ""incident"" where RDA thugs *murdered children for damaging some equipment*. Gee, I wonder why *that* would sour relations

> the Na'vi prodding at the RDA settlement

Here's the abuser logic again.  The RDA is an occupying force destroying their land and being increasingly hostile to their people.  They have every right to fight back.  Especially after a bunch of their kids get murdered in cold blood.

> don't treat the Na'vi as saints that did nothing wrong

This all sounds suspiciously like Russian BS about Ukraine.  The victim blaming, pointing at someone defending themselves from attack/occupation and saying ""look, they're violent and aggressive!"" and trying to re-frame the discussion with ""well they aren't saints either!""

According to the visual dictionary, the RDA plans to have 2 million people in Bridgehead.  A big portion of the city is set aside for a corporate HQ.

They're planning to evacuate the ultra-wealthy and well-connected (and the workers required to support their lavish lifestyle) and leave everyone else on Earth to die.  Bridgehead is designed for people to live a comfortable, modern urban lifestyle.  Not exactly what you should prioritize if the survival of the species is at stake.

The second movie drops unobtainium all together and undermines justification of the vast expense in both money and time it takes to go to Pandora. Instead, they divert to the Amrita, which comes with a near comical level of evil to obtain and extract, serves no overall useful purpose in the ways unobtainium would.

I think them scorching the forest when they landed also served to just immediately clear out the plants and wildlife that would be keeping them from more unobtainium, so basically I don't think they're desperate for unobtainuim at this point (until they deplete their sources), hence why it's not a big part of the plot.

"Well that wouldn’t necessarily be the case actually if it’s a dominant gene. Also keep in mind that not all traits are as simple as one gene from male parent, one from female parent. In many cases it’s a combination of genes from both parents.

However in cases where it’s one gene from each parent, with the extra digit being caused by a dominant gene, that wouldn’t happen. 

So I’d say each parent has two genes for hand development. Let’s call the recessive gene ‘f’ and the dominant extra digit gene ‘F’. Jake has the gene combination of Ff and Neytiri would have ff. Loak inherited F from Jake and f from Neytiri, resulting in him having Ff, the rest of the kids inherited f from Jake and Neytiri, resulting in ff and therefore having four digits


In this case it would be possible for one of Loaks descendants several generations down the line, being the first in generations to have ff and four fingers, even though all x amount of the lineage between them would have had the extra digit",6,kh330xv,Avatar,t3_192az36,t1_kh31s7z,1704824385.0

"Not to be a spoilsport, but it might literally kill them. Their whole biology is a fundamentally different path from all Earth lifeforms. Meaning that we evolved hundreds of millions of years to extract energy from particular plant and animal products like starches or proteins. Perhaps some of these are also produced by Pandoran lifeforms, but there is no guarantee.  

Human food would be to them basically a lot of foreign chemicals, which could be either indigestible or at worst outright poisonous. For example the ability to digest milk and tolerate alcohol varies even among human populations a lot, with many pre-agricultural peoples having a low or no alcohol tolerance at all. Then you have for example chocolate being poisonous to dogs and they are still just other mammals. So many plants have poisons which we adapted to tolerate (or bred out of them via domestication).  

I fear the most edible human food for Na'vi would also be the blandest, basically just bare starches and proteins rid of every potentially dangerous chemical.

Despite Spider's arguments regarding his innocence and the fact that he had nothing to do with his parents' crimes, Neytiri ignored any words from the boy.

Firstly humans should stops being the one at fault, and change how they are so it's possibe for na'vi to have a different perspective on them, which is yet to happen as the invasion and imperialism is still very much happening. na'vi shouldn't ever forgive humans because humans will abuse them again and again. so the final answer is, op, nothing. because humans are unwilling to show the na'vi any other different facet and even if they did it would be disingenuous as they keep murdering and pillaging their entire planet.",0,jjupuxt,Avatar,t3_13dq9i5,t3_13dq9i5,1683884138.0

">The entire American population isn't trying to permanently move to Iraq

Semantics. Besides, it was still an evil war that sent ***hundreds of thousands*** of Americans soldiers to their territory. Plus it was largely based on reaping economic profits for corporations, which is what the RDA is doing.

>So far humanity hasn't done anything to deserve this degree of charity from the Na'vi

What are on you about??? It was also humanity that saved them in the first film. Jake, Trudy, Norm, and several dozen scientists disobeyed the RDA and largely helped the Na'vi win the battle. Ewya was the big factor, of course, but it was a human that prayed to her and a human that was appointed by her to integrate.

I truly don't understand why some people in this sub are so keen on hating their own humanity so much.

Bridgehead was very developed merely one year after they arrived so the construction of the new city must have started shortly after their arrival.

Common misinterpretation, the RDA is there to make money and are willing to play nice. This is a corporation not a deathsquad, it's a commentary on the banality of evil. Jake's intolerance of the RDA is justified, but if the RDA was hoping strictly for escalation and violence they would've acted much differently.

The point of negotiations is leverage and profit, the RDA did not expect Jake to be so prepared and committed, and Jake did not expect the RDA to return with such massive, long-term plans.

Actually you got this backwards. Peace negotiations are done exactly like this in real life. If you don't do it this way, you're doing it wrong. Just open a history book. Without threat, then it is no different from strongly worded letter.

You're right that RDA wasn't interested in offering old jobs back (because that's dumb they can sabotage your base). But it isn't because of threat - they did that part right. The part they did wrong was that they were being too generous as to OFFER OLD JOBS BACK. In other words they were not using too much violence, rather the opposite; they were using too little of it.

"While I agree that unobtanium is better written than amrita, they both bring up more questions than answers and, unless there is more reasoning explained in the 3rd movie, are both bad reasons to go to Pandora.

1. Unobtanium is described as a metal/mineral superconductor which works at room temperature. This is all well and good, but why is it only found on Pandora? That makes no sense. In the universe, elements are more or less distributed in a pattern which starts when hydrogen coalesces into a star, and ends when the star goes supernova and spreads the elements formed through nuclear fusion in a more or less spherical shape around it. If unobtanium exists and isn't an artificially manufactured product, it would have been created not only when the matter from a supernova coalesced into the moon Pandora, but when the matter coalesced into most of the planets orbiting Polyphemus' star, and Polyphemus and Pandora's sister moons. Unobtanium should exist throughout that solar system, not just on the one planet/moon which has a thriving intelligent culture living on it. There is no reason for the events surrounding the movie Avatar given other than the existence of Unobtanium within the moon, so why are they even on Pandora, a planet covered in life and jungles, when it would be much, much easier to harvest Unobtanium from one of the many dead moons co-orbiting Polyphemus? More importantly, why does Unobtanium seem to be located specifically in areas connected with the Na'vi? Did they decide to live on areas with large amounts of Unobtanium because of its effects on the area, or **were they already there before Unobtanium appeared?**

2. Amrita is a chemical compound made within the heads of the Tulkun. I could understand hunting for samples of Amrita when it is first discovered, but why do they continue after those initial samples are found? Consider the technological development on Earth at the time: they would be able to synthesize Amrita in a lab after studying those first samples, and the companies which began mass-producing the stuff would have started making a killing *without* having to spend untold amounts of cash to travel to Polyphemus, and that should be the end of the Tulkun hunt. Why are they still being hunted? Who would spend billions and billions on a chemical which should be being mass-produced by now? **And why do the Na'vi seem to have this connection with the Tulkun, the one creature which produces Amrita?**

There exist laws within which the Na'vi live, the Laws of Eywa. Some of these laws don't really make sense for a society which supposedly never experienced advanced technology until humanity arrived, and one of the theories is that Eywa herself created the laws. But I don't buy it. I think that the Na'vi are a post-apocalyptic society, living in the aftermath of a major disaster which had long-reaching repercussions for all the Na'vi, as well as Pandora. I believe that the reason Unobtanium only exists on Pandora, is because **it was created there by the Na'vi** prior to the establishment of the Laws of Eywa. The same for the Amrita and the Tulkun. I think the Tulkun are the descendants of creatures domesticated by the Na'vi some time in their distant past.

But I am probably overthinking it and it could just be a series of weird macguffins created just to advance the plot despite how little sense they make for a universe based on the laws of physics.

However, I personally never got the impression that Unobtanium itself actually _floats,_ just that the display he keeps that particular piece on is magnetic or something, kind of like one of [these](https://bbts1.azureedge.net/images/p/full/2017/12/254dc8cc-4981-42d5-93bc-dfe8091d9f32.jpg) desk toys.

"As a physicist, I loved the concept of Unobtanium in the first movie. Unobtanium is imagined as a 'room temperature superconductor,' a theoretical concept that's currently one of the major pursuits in the field of physics due to its potential wide range of applications.

Indeed, superconductors, materials that can conduct electric current without resistance, are real. They display a property known as the Meissner effect, which makes them repel magnetic fields, causing them to levitate in the presence of a magnetic field. This phenomenon could be seen in Selfridge's office with the floating platform, which likely contained a magnet.

That is exactly how superconductors behave. You can see a demonstration of this effect in real life superconductors in many online videos, such as this one: [Superconductor Levitation](https://youtu.be/VyOtIsnG71U)

However, the primary challenge with superconductors in real life is that they only exhibit these unique properties at extremely low temperatures, usually requiring cooling by substances like liquid nitrogen or helium. You can see that in the video above (the constant fumes come from the liquid nitrogen). This requirement for intense cooling makes many potential applications impractical due to the complexity and expense of the necessary cooling systems.

While researchers worldwide are endeavoring to discover or create a room temperature superconductor, its existence is yet unproven. If such a material could be found, it would revolutionize numerous technologies, and it would be an extremely valued material, as in the films. This wouldn't just be due to its levitation property, but also because of its ability to sustain an electric current indefinitely without energy loss.",44,jmrnine,Avatar,t3_13ze8sf,t1_jmr79at,1685815438.0

"> One thing I find curious is that amrita was only found within the past year

here's the thing... was it?

There is a few things off about the timelines surrounding Amrita which suggests RDA might have known about it back in A1. 

* Why hire and ship out a man like Scoresby for something they didn't know exist

* Garvin's backstory in the VD doesn't really align with the timescale, apparently getting his own boat, establishing relations with the Metkayina, discovering Amrita and getting blackmailed by RDA into working on the hunting missions, all with in a year. It doesn't sound right. 

* RDA just having all the equipment and vechiles including navalised aircraft like the seawasp ready to roll (or at least built).

* Payakan's offical pandorapedia page describes the events that caused his exile has happening years ago

All of this point in my mind to Garvin discovering Amrita back before A1, probadly hunting down and killing Payakan's mum in the process (and possibly discovering the anti-aging effect by testing it on himself). I'm not sure why this isn't explained in A2 (and Payakan's flashback directly conflicts with).

Bridgehead is too fortified for an army of beasts to work, so a deadly disease is the only possible way to get rid of the humans.

"Maybe it begins with understanding that, in a sense, you are already in union with the world around you. You do not need to (re-)connect with nature; you are nature itself, as is everything and everyone else. There is nothing that is *not* nature, nothing that does not belong. You are the universe itself come to life so that it can better understand its own existence. There is no balance to reset because there was never any balance to upset. Unity *was not* and unity *will not be;* unity already *is.*

Feel that connection deeply and truly. Know it in your bones. Look into the eyes of any other human being, rich or poor, ""good"" or ""evil"", of any color or creed or age and see yourself. See yourself in the rocks and trees and the water and the stars. See yourself in your friends and enemies, in ""God"" and in the complete absence of ""God"". Know yourself, know not-yourself, no difference.

And, as you come to know this, see what it leads you to do. See how it leads you to regard other people and the ground you all walk on. See how it encourages you to care not only for your own peace, but for the peace of everyone. See what action it stirs in you.

I'm not saying that any massive societal change occurs by one single person changing their perspective; it's a group effort. But any such group requires lots of single people to be on the same page, to want the same outcome for the same fundamental reason. If we're getting anywhere, we're gonna have to get there together.

So find those groups of people who feel the same. If you can't find them, try getting that ball rolling yourself. Do that soul-searching for yourself and share your findings (gently, lovingly, without judgment) with your neighbors.

Their level of connection and honesty is so strong that they don't even have a word for ""lie"". 

The lack of these abilities is what keeps us from reaching that level of connection.

"Watch Bruce Parry's ""Tribe"" or ""Going Tribal"" series. (Same series, different names.)

It explores various tribal peoples around the world in a very respectful manner, shows their challenges as well as things they have much better than us (hunter-gatherers working 3 hours a day, spending all the rest of it with each other? Yes please!), and things that are a bit too... uncomfortable for modern sensibilities to include in a film like Avatar. (Meaning our own tribal peoples are basically more alien than the Na'vi.)

I just started watching it all again after just skimming a bit of it a decade ago, and it's /so/ nice. Bruce is also a genuinely awesome guy who truly tries to live like and understand each and every tribe he finds himself with.

He also wants to create a sort of tribe of his own.

Lynx Vilden, a British-Swedish woman who is a master of stone age life, wants to do something similar (and she was featured twice on Ben Fogle's ""New Lives in the Wild"").

Of course, it's very difficult to do anything of the sort in a 1st world country due to legal reasons (especially when children are involved), and the second obstacle is to find actual quality people. I dare say 98-99% of people today are way too emotionally immature, ego-centric, individualistic and small-minded to even attempt something like this.

Obviously I'm not talking about you since I don't know you, but I've frequently seen various ""commune"" projects fall apart because grown people were just acting like toddlers with each other. Other than that, you need a solid spiritual or other form of tribal ""glue"" to keep people together through the generations, raising your children and eventually grandchildren together.

As you might notice, I have given it a lot of thought, since I was a member of an aspiring tribe that was created following Avatar's release (it fell apart around 2014-15), and observer of the ""Real life Na'vi tribe"" project, which fell apart even sooner.

"I’ve spent some time thinking about this. I’ve got a small group of friends that were absolutely down to throw in on some land with me and live off grid/in harmony with nature yadda yadda. All of us were raised hunting and fishing and farming/gardening. At some point in the process I realized we were planning out a commune. I dropped the planning pretty soon after that because communes just don’t give you that fuzzy soft “this is absolutely not a cult” feeling you know? 

If you wanted to avoid the whole commune thing, you could theoretically do a sort of hunter/gatherer version of an Amish type community. Every family owns their own land, power is fairly decentralized beside matters of the church, but you still foster that sense of community, still hunter/gatherer. In my thinking though, that would also require Amish kind of numbers in the community to make work. It doesn’t seem to me it’s the kind of plan that would work with just a few friends for instance. 

Your two biggest issues would be paying property taxes and the loan used to buy the land, and being self sufficient so you’re not relying on the Walmart in town. Both of those would seem to resolve easier with a larger community. Also, even though it’s not Avatar levels of harmony, I would seriously consider agriculture.

Perhaps finding a compromise between Hunter gatherer and more modern lifestyle ? What about perma culture for example ? 

There were some people on earth which managed to find more harmony with environment and survived thousands of years this way and we all need to return to this. Maybe lived less long I agree but more free and happy.

And all of that gross disgusting water is going to slowly make its way down from the canopy, until it reaches the leaf that Neytiri drinks from. And that's of course assuming this leaf didn't also have animal feces and dead animals inside of it.

"🙂 The group I was in was born on one of the Avatar forums in 2010, but quickly made its own forum because it needed to separate itself and make sure ""We were inspired by Avatar to want to live in nature, but this is very much a grown-up project and real life goal, and not Na'vi cosplay"" (my wording now). The name was pending and ended up becoming ""Blue Moon Tribe"" (after a member who helped start it up but disappeared).

The oldest of our members was 37 at the time, and she held the server of the board among other things. The forum was amazing with so much information on how to live in the woods, permaculture and such, but unfortunately it was taken down by hackers after a few years.

These projects are still discussed at times on Avatar forums + Tree of Souls (AF is down now for a time), and a lot of the old members of BMT are still around on there.

Like I said, BMT fell apart after some years - by early 2015, we had gone from 15-20 active members to ~4 - because of lack of funding and a location, so people simply lost motivation.

The idea was to buy a large plot of land with forest and possibility for hunting (generally banned in countries with rainforests), which means a lot of money.

And since members lived everywhere from the US to the EU, the Philippines and Chile, it was difficult to decide, since most people would have to emigrate.

Some, like the oldest member, decided they didn't want to leave their homeland or speak English for the rest of their lives.

Today, I would say to 1) pick a location in the US and/or one in Europe or Australia or wherever you're at, since everyone moving to Argentina or Belize is not feasible.
We spent way too much time looking at the suitability of countries we had no idea how to move to.

2) Set realistic goals on how much land and how the lifestyle will work. We imagined being part-time hunter-gatherers (with permaculture in addition), which would require hundreds of acres. While hunting for food is not very realistic today, it also doesn't have to be on /your/ private land. What kind of dwellings, land ownership, etc? (Look at how more ""wild"" ecovillages do it.)

3) And of course, what we skipped entirely since we were still in the online stage - vetting people, as you said. I dismissed it when I heard someone chime in from the outside on the Real-life Na'vi Tribe (on Learn Na'vi forums), that you as a group need a common spirituality or ideology. But it's true. We were such an assortment of different beliefs, our common denominator was basically loving nature, and it's not enough to keep a group together in the long term.

And to go back to the shows I mentioned, I love watching ""Tribe"" for how it shows us how ""real"" humans live, with the absence of civilization.
But ""New Lives in the Wild"" is great for seeing how people left civilization and did something else, so we can learn from them.

Notably, these people are either singles, families, or in the rare cases of ""communes"", a transient community where people come and go constantly. It is not easy to build a true tribe where people will want to stay and raise their children and there will be no infighting, but I would love to see it if they exist. 🙂",3,jjyym0r,Avatar,t3_13ceee4,t1_jjh5bob,1683959183.0

"Exactly. To expand on your point, until someone invents a way for us to connect our brains to the mosquitos, and ask them politely to leave us alone, we're never going to be able to live like the Na'vi. I don't enjoy slathering myself with DEET when I go walking in the summer, but I live near a swamp--if I don't, I'll be an itchy mess for days. And I don't even live in a place where malaria is endemic!

"Lots of other commenters hit on this, but the biggest side effect of spending a lot of time in nature is that you stop mystifying and glamorizing it. Avatar is 100% a glamorization of nature. In the actual wilderness, you have to deal with things like:  


\- Exposure. On Earth, you have to deal with environmental temperatures over 100 degrees F during the day and below 40 degrees at night. That gets old.  


\- Insects & Arachnids. I love arthropods, I actually went into my degree to study them. I'm still not a fan of dozens of fresh bites per day without DEET, or having a massive spider crawl over my chest as I'm falling asleep.  


\- Work. There's an often-touted statistic that claims hunter-gatherers do much less work than modern humans, but I take that with a heavy grain of salt. When you're away from civilization, the only way to get things done is to actually do it with your human muscles. That could mean literal hours spent hunched over grinding grains into flour by hand, for example.  


\- Food variety. Whether you're foraging or just brought in preserved rations, you're going to be eating pretty much the same thing or sets of things every day for weeks or months on end.   


\- Disease. Like a commenter above mentions, Earth isn't like Pandora where you can just drink water out of a random leaf. [Here you just get giardia.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giardia-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20372786)  


\- Cleanliness. One of the reasons disease can be so worrying is that it's really hard to stay clean when you're in the sticks. You will be a dirty sweaty mess, and unless you have access to fresh water, you will stay a dirty sweaty mess.   


\- Predators and natural hazards. This is hard to really convey to people who haven't experienced it, but if you get out into brown bear country or go walking in a rattlesnake area, you are at real physical risk. Over time that gets old.  


After several months of that, it is unbelievably nice to come back to an air-conditioned house with a full refrigerator of food and take a nice warm shower.",11,jjh7261,Avatar,t3_13ceee4,t1_jjfw4hk,1683644464.0

"“Infinite growth” probably isn’t going to happen. Studies show that birth rate actually decreases when a society reaches a certain standard of living and egalitarian way of life, and many first world countries are approaching that threshold. 

Going off and living in a hunter-gatherer commune isn’t going to be as fun as avatar makes it look. Cavemen lived pretty short, brutal lives where a lot of their kids didn’t make it past 4 and those that did were highly likely to die via shitting themselves to death at some point. We’re not Na’vi, Earth isn’t Pandora, and we sure didn’t have a forest god looking out for us. We were never in “harmony” with nature, we were subjects to it.

A much more realistic goal is advancing society and technology to become more harmonized with nature, not regressing it.

"Everything is part of a wider energy network, including our possessions and our relations. So they are never destroyed, but rather change form and place. It's the First Law of Thermodynamics.

The ramifications of this mindset are truly profound. Material possessions become more ethereal and less important, because while they may require a cost to replace they are always replaceable. And in the end, nothing lasts forever, so why put in so much time and effort into possessions that can be misplaced, damaged, or destroyed?

3) Humans don't belong alone. Banishment was the worst possible punishment for ancient peoples, worse than death. Obviously you should do it with a tribe, unless you really are a hermit.

4) I have never heard that from any tribal people or modern people who went back to the wild. They don't see it as ""destroying"" to fell a tree or shoot an animal, rather they see it as living as a small part of a bigger world, deeply entwined with it.

Realistically, I see no other option for ""humanity's future"". The unequal distribution of the basic necessities of life will destroy society. There is no other outcome.

Infinite growth is unsustainable, and Capitalism *only* functions on infinite growth. It is impossible to predict how the change will come, either through revolution or simple collapse, but if humanity, and life on this planet in general, is going to persist such exploitation will have to end. 

At this point, all we can do is begin to organize and build resiliency into our communities in order to prepare them for these changes.

They miss that the aliens are purposefully made to look disgusting, and we are not really shown if they really caused what the human government propaganda claims, so people just connect their pre-concieved disgust of bugs (basically xenophobia, or space racism :D) , with the propaganda, uncritically gobbled up by the masses news, to justify their hate. In other words while you are in a state of disgust and fear from how they look, you are much more likely to believe information that confirms that disgust. So people easily believe ""bug = bad"".

While in actuality, humanity just perpetuates imperialist expansionism in the Starship Trooper's movie universe, and they have started the war with the bugs, by just swallowing up every star system they can for themselves in a galactic expansion that doesn't give a shit about other life forms. Other life forms which they just antagonize, and then the retaliation is used as justification to exterminate them.

"The idea that these young *adults* who are explicitly told not to go beyond a certain point, because of predators, are not perpetually aware of the dangers, is ignoring the reality of their existence. 

They even knew about an Exiled being in the area. Stories that he would attack, while wrong, were actively being circulated at that time.

The 'tone of the film' of course is at odds with it. Because they're actively ignoring the dissonance with the story. 

Why are these people, who again: have an active, real, and loving GOD, literally no better than human tribals? *They should be more cohesive*. 

It's actual narrative dissonance. With a God they they physically connect to, and can communicate with, the Na'vi should demonstrate a unified, communal self that humans are unable to understand. But they don't. It's literally just basic tribal animism. 

Even worse, they still demonstrate primitve hierarchies and ""Othering"". This is more egregious since Kiri, who provably has a deeper connection to Eywa than usual is the victim of such treatment. They are treating what would be considered a Prophet as a lesser. 

The movie is treating a culture that behaves similar to what'd usually be the villains, as the heroes. And how? By simply pitting them against a worse one: Runaway Militant Capitalism.",2,kv5pm34,Avatar,t3_1bf9ait,t1_kv58at0,1710607220.0
"Just because faith is more tangible for the Na'vi shouldn't automatically mean that somehow they're above certain slights and personal disputes. There are countless on Earth who believe sincerely in higher powers, and some of those people behave suboptimally to others with the same faith within their own cultures and communities, so it seems pretty obvious to me that god alone isn't some panacea for poor behavior.

Eywa's balance and connection is a general thing, not some uniform mindset where everything everywhere lives in absolute unity. That harmony is a mean - A few people with free will being shitty to one another (And who mend the rifts between them to boot) isn't in conflict with some ideal that overall, the Na'vi live much more in tune with the world around them.

As a narrative about family and cultures, there are going to be warts involved as that's what generates conflict, a feature of damn near every conventional Western narrative. The film isn't trying to portray these flaws as acceptable only in the face of a greater evil - it's trying to show people encountering and overcome conflict as good, but imperfect, people do, and I really think you're misreading intent if you're taking those parts of these films, which exaggerate for effect, as a sign of some underlying cruelty.

"I felt legit nothing when they killed him off, they didn't do enough character development for him, since he was planned to die it meant they didn't wanna waste much time trying to make us attached to him or care for him. The best way to handle a death like that would be that he goes in as a hero and does a whole lot of stuff and then get mortally wounded in a direct confrontation with the bad guy after having taken down most of the enemy troops, maybe even barely hanging on to life and we get the ""I wanna go home"" as his last words before dying out a bit later, maybe even after the fight have concluded or in a way that would make sense.

To me it just seems like lazy or forced death because they needed to have it checked off on they to do list, so they made an extra hollow character for the pure purpose of killing him later, without showing us pretty much anything that would have us emotionally invested in him.

TL:DR I don't think he had enough screen time nor having us basically see him do much of anything for the death to matter emotionally whatsoever, it also felt super predictable with his death as he was obviously a disposable side character.",3,j1v62cp,Avatar,t3_zpl2qa,t3_zpl2qa,1672161518.0

"Congrats on having the least productive take on this issue.

In all seriousness though, it's this kind of language I despise. Insisting that people *like* seeing signs of racism or other prejudice in the media they consume.

Personally, I hate it. I hate being reminded of real-world issues when all I'm looking for is an escape. At least in the instance that the media I'm consuming is potentially making those issues worse. 

However, as uncomfortable as it is, it's also necessary. Media never exists in a vacuum. It can influence and reinforce someone's worldview for better or worse. 

That's why I'm glad people are talking about potential messages of White Saviorism in Avatar. As unpleasant as it is, you can't get around the fact that it's at least towing that line in plot synopsis alone. And the issue should be brought up. Not for the sake of ""canceling"" James Cameron, his films, or the people who enjoy them. But to encourage critical thinking in regard to media.

"Neteyam was the child who spent the most time with his parents. Not just being born first, but he had also been raised to become the future chief of their previous clan that they had to desert: the Omatikaya. You can see in the movie that he is flying with his parents flocking on both of his sides when they are communicating with the rest of their children who were together and up to no good. He is shown to be less involved in his younger siblings' antics and rather taking responsibility for it as Jake demands it of him. Without a doubt, losing any child regardless of being the first-born or not is world shattering. But I do believe that Neteyam was loved the most dearly by Neytiri. Similar names, similar Na'vi appearance (Lo'ak resembles their father with five fingers and the eyes; Neteyam had four like Tuk and Neytiri), similar proficiency (he guided Lo'ak failing his first attempt), and gave his mother a secure peace of mind with just knowing how he would always take care of his siblings since Neytiri already lost her own elder sister Sylwanin many years ago.

"Any intelligent life would inevitably mess up their planet, which is one of the reason they might move to next, few energy sources are 100% renewable and pollutant neutral, even the ones that seem like it  aren't completely renewable, (eg lithium mined for batteries and silicon for solar cells) moreover humans go to pandora in 2154 that's just 131 years apart so they are not that advanced compared to today's tech,  realistically speaking the planet would continue to get messed up even if they'd gone green, climate change is inevitable, that's what caused multiple ice ages earlier, yes it is accelerated by human activities but they can't just change their ways, for them they themselves come first, then the planet
They are trying to advance as a species, turning earth to shit is an inevitable part of that, they must ensure their survival as their earth is dying, even if it means eradication of entire Navi population or destroying their planet for unobtainium they need, they'll definitely mess up pandora as well but if they survive long enough they'll reach sustainability.

I do agree that  everything needs to be balanced to thrive but that balance doesn't come easily or quickly, it comes from trial and error and judgment of past deeds, the balance Navis are practicing isn't getting them anywhere, they are not improving technologically, had we not dug the Earth we wouldn't have electricity, nor would we have rockets, had we not cut trees down, we wouldn't have certain medicines, curiosity and hunger to improve is a characteristic of intelligent life, developing newer ways to survive and thrive is what we live by as an intelligent species, Navi culture separates them from  this basic character and thus makes the vulnerable, a country getting attacked by missiles, if it is developed enough can atleast protect itself with countermeasures while an undeveloped country with tribes could only shoot bows and arrows at them.I hope you get what I am trying to say here, be it humans or be it navis neither of them are right or wrong here, both are just competing, navis are just the undeveloped country here.

I think in the movies, humans are being generous, as shown in the movies they have the technology to merge two entirely different bodies, which requires complete control over gene editing and epigenetics, meaning that they must also have the ability to create microbial or retroviral bioweapon which could kill almost all life on pandora, this method is also less energy consuming and since they're so advanced in doing this they could also make it painless and instant, instead they chose to destroy a certain area of land to acquire unobtainium, killing a few is better tha killing all I guess.",3,jih1igu,Avatar,t3_1345fit,t1_jifq0t5,1682971044.0

Eywa being able to attach to Navi and control so many species has little to no Intermediate step which is beneficial, so I don't see a route for evolution.

That said, the universe is dangerous and Earth has life and is very close (in cosmic terms). The Navi leaving so little defence seems like poor judgement. I would more suspect that the technological Navi are out there still.",0,jieodhz,Avatar,t3_1345fit,t1_jieo7az,1682928353.0

I accept that yes, it might be another species, but it's very clearly set up that someone did all this genetic engineering.

Eywa is actually an almost exact copy of ""habitat mentality"" and ""consensus"" group minds formed from the ascended memories of the dying which look after their descendants from the sci fi series ""the nights Dawn Trilogy"". In that book, they are a product of advanced biotechnology. The scene where they go are revisit their sons memories as they exist in Eywa is almost directly stolen from the book as well (in the book the character revisits a version of her dead brother who lives forever as a child. Interestingly, reliving memories of when they go boating together), so it seems almost certain that Cameron read it.

"While it's often been the focal point, ""the world's fucked because resources/climate"" is *basically* the entirety of the early-Cyberpunk genre. *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep* hangs most of its plot on that as a world concept. There were nuclear *elements* to that yes, but the climate gets about as much attention. Most Cyberpunk novels include some ""the resources of this world are unfairly distributed and so caused this collapse"" by the nature of the genre.  

 Even early Star Trek had a strong focus there, with an apocalyptic resource shortage being what spurred humanity towards space. It depends on where you look in terms of breadth really, but Sci-fi has been involved on the climate/resource direction before nuclear was arong. It usually tends towards a more ""singular solution"" outcome than a communal  or systemic one. 

Seeing a more communal/systemic change direction as the ""solution"" built into Avatar really helps it escape some of the places other sci-fi gets mangled.

"This thread raises a number of questions, some of which have been raised and discussed on various threads in this sub.

What it comes down to is this: how many humans back on Earth are aware of what is really happening on Pandora and what the RDA is doing there?

And, do enough humans care about Pandora and are willing to stand up to the RDA to stop them from destroying Pandora and the Na'vi?

The answer to those questions will determine the narrative arc of the next three movies.

I don't think James Cameron wants to end the franchise on a downer note.  We already know the Disney ride is canon to the Avatar universe.  That ride strongly suggests that there will be be peace between the humans and the Na'vi.

How that peace is arrived at and how the human race comes to an understanding with the Na'vi is up to James Cameron.

I suspect a big part of that will be having a majority of the human race turn against the RDA.

It will be interesting to see how JC pulls that off.

Some fanfic writers have addressed the idea that the human race might come to a place of peace with the Na'vi and how that might come about, with varying degrees of success.

I took it on in my fan novel, and I suspect there will be more than one or two fanfics that will take it on in the coming years, as we see the narrative arc evolve.",9,jhvnwpd,Avatar,t3_12zvmml,t3_12zvmml,1682568478.0

Jim has touched on these topics and the lore explains some items too:

\- The RDA is the villain of the entire Avatar saga, their defeats are expensive, but not strategically crippling. This is a 'serial' just like Cobra in GI Joe or the Red Ribbon Army in Dragon Ball their resources are (from a dramatic writing standpoint) limitless. Despite canonically it not being so. 

\- Recoms are a 'run-off' project of the overarching plan that spawned the original Avatars as well. Constructing RDA personnel unshackled by rebreathers/sealed environments. It's a 'one-and-done' proof of concept. Both Pheonix and Avatar, the technological breakthroughs are the goal, not the products. Hence why the loses of the Avatars and Recoms don't distress or phase the RDA in the slightest, nor do they explicitly manufacture more. From a production standpoint, it allows for the games to include player characters without breaching the lore. 

Lots of fan theories get thrown into disarray because Jim's intentions seem to contradict what he produces, but when you look at it from a business standpoint IRL, the lore is a lot clearer.",9,jhwnrli,Avatar,t3_12zvmml,t1_jhw4b3o,1682595330.0

"> Na'vi don't have the numbers.

Which is why the *true* end goal is the ""joint anti-RDA rebellion"" is back on *Earth*. Humanity will *have* to stand up in support of the Na'vi if there is going to be *any* end to the exploitation of both planets.",12,jhuhpqr,Avatar,t3_12zvmml,t1_jhu2kr0,1682548790.0
">Na'vi don't have the numbers. Clans we see in movie are not that big actually. 

Yes, clans do not seem big in numbers, but there's one thing that i think people confuse. When the lore says that ""pandora has 15 clans"", i think they're referring to peoples. And when Jake says in the first movie that he's got 15 clans by his side, he may be referring to actual clans, which are part of a larger group of people. So, there is the tropical forest people like in the first movie, the reef people like in the second one, etc. But each of these people has several/multiple/many clans. The Omatikaya clan could be just one of the clans/tribes that live in the tropical rainforest. The clan led by Tonowari could be just a tribe of the reef people, but the others that are attacked by the recoms seem to be other clans that could be independent from Tonowari (they seem to have their own Oloyektans/Tsahiks). 

So, the na'vi have at least 15 peoples: tropical na'vi, ash people, arctic na'vi, boreal forest na'vi, the reef people, the ones in the arid highlands, the ones in the wetlands, the people of the desert - called ""windtraders""; other na'vi reside in the temperate forest; and others we don't know yet. And each of these peoples may have an unknown number of clans/tribes, each lead by an Oloyektan or Tsahik. For example, each tribe living in the tropical forest may have it's own hometree. When the RDA invades Pandora at the beginning of A2, in the fire we can see about two or three hometrees being destroyed, if i'm not mistaken. The na'vi could be more numerous than we estimate at the moment. It doesn't change much, but still.",2,jhw6221,Avatar,t3_12zvmml,t1_jhu2kr0,1682580859.0

"I'm mostly with you, OP! The things that distinguish Avatar for me:  
• The world-building is absolutely next-level. This has been done before with alien cultures and/or futuristic human civilization, but I can't think of another movie that went so deep on its alien ecosystem. Dune is the clear forerunner on this front, but I think Avatar surpassed it in terms of the depth and breadth of biological world-building. Cameron clearly wants to see that animals, plants, and their surroundings are all connected... and Avatar makes that overt. It's very powerful, on top of being a generally interesting setting.  
• It's a big-budget blockbuster that actually has a moral, and makes a strong ethical point that relates to the real world and humanity's future. If you think about it, this is very rare: most movies have a moral/ethical message along the lines of ""teamwork"" or ""be a good person"". Avatar really had something to say, and I admire that (especially because I personally agree with the stance it takes).

"The natural world. The creatures, the plants and the trees and everything being lit with bioluminescence. The world is just so breathtakingly beautiful. Plus I have always loved jungles and forests so a moon covered almost entirely in them is a big win for me.One of the big reasons I’m so exited for Frontiers of pandora is that I will finally be able to explore the world. I will probably be exploring the world more than actually going after objectives. 

I was never a huge fan of the story in the first movie but I didn’t mind it either. The world building behind the story however is quite interesting and I think extremely relevant to how current events are going. I have no doubt that humanity can screw up Earth exactly how humanity did in the movie. So in a sense the whole story is a actually very believable and likely and sadly, a fairly accurate depiction of the future humanity.

EDIT: 
Forgot to mention how well thought out all the human tech is. Everything reads like machines that could actually be constructed by us given advancements in the future. The Valkyrie is probably one of my all time favorite transport aircraft designs and the Samson is probably one of my all time favorite futurist helicopter designs.

"Plot-wise, it's a pretty typical (slightly above-average) action adventure franchise. But they just went so. fucking. hard. on the worldbuilding. Way way way way more than was necessary to make a perfectly coherent story. And they did it as realistically as possible, in-line with current science. Even the interstellar travel is the absolute best, most realistic depiction of what future interstellar travel will probably look like that's ever been put on screen. The Na'vi characters speak in accents that a native Na'vi speaker would use when speaking English. The evolutionary history of the organisms on Pandora was thought out (and then never documented, just left to fans to figure out by watching). The night sky looking exactly as it would from a moon orbiting a planet in the Alpha Centauri A system.  


It's just overwhelming and it's right the hell up my alley. There are so many details that were put in for absolutely no reason other than so *maybe* a few hundred people on the entire planet would notice the work they put into it. I have to reiterate just how completely unnecessary it was to do it that hard, but they did it anyway. And the fact that I'm constantly sitting there, watching the movie and thinking ""I wonder how that works."" or ""I wonder what caused that geological formation."" (I'm a geologist) as I watch turned out to be the perfect combo for me, personally, as a scientist (sensu lato) to completely suspend disbelief when I watch Avatar. It remains yet the only movie franchise in which I've had dreams that take place in the universe of the movies and when I'm having those dreams I'm completely immersed.

"For once, the Internet is right. There is a lot about modern life that should make us grateful. Most (not all, but most) of the perceived advantages of past eras are mythologized versions of realities that people today would consider quite grim. Even primitivism apologists end up sounding mostly ridiculous. It usually goes something like:

""You just don't understand modern paleoanthropological consensus! Sure, half of the people died before adulthood, but most of the people who survived that only worked 30 hours a week and *probably* wouldn't die of disease or starvation. They'd get to die because of a blood feud with the neighboring tribe instead!""

The real utility of social criticism like Avatar is forward-looking. Don't fetishize the past and strive to return to it. That only kinda sorta works for the Na'vi, and only then because they already have their godlike AI and fully compatible wetware mods. You don't have those advantages. Identify *values* from these hypothetical worlds and people that matter to you - ecological conservatism, maybe, or social communitatianism, or hierarchical marital pairing decided by your parents when you're born, whatever it might be - and let the movies inspire you to promote adapting your current environment to value those more.

"You are so correct and I think it would have been so much harder to live in the past due to the lack of technological advances and the underdeveloped values of society. 

Some of it is about perspective. There are things that will definitely prove how privileged we are living now but there are people who are not educated of the hardships experienced in the past and currently by people living in poverty and because of that, they will consider their problems to be on the same scale as the problems of a person living in the past. 

I think life is about perspective and because of that, sadness, happiness and other emotions are relative to the person experiencing them. Someone living in the past could never have guessed how easy it is to live now and therefore, they would never have even considered the possibility that their life is hard. To them, their hardships are another aspect of life and they would calibrate their emotions like happiness or sadness accordingly. 

When we compare the lives of people in the past and people now, we see the huge difference but if you were born 500 years ago, losing a loved one would have been less heartbreaking(still heartbreaking but not to the extent of what someone would experience today) because of how desensitized they are. They probably see that the we see the loss of loved ones to old age. Sure, it is sad but not everyone lives forever and because perspective is relative, people living 500 years in the future would say how difficult our current lives are now because of how easy it is for them(they could have achieved immortality and a higher\heightened state of existing).

I love how the world of Avatar portrays this and even though many people say it is not an accurate depiction of what a tribal alien race would be like, they have have to understand that the Na’vi know their reason for existing, their God(Eywa) and because they have figured out so many aspects of their life, they have no need for war, injustice and other bad things. They would know how to live properly and that way is through peace and protecting their world.",4,j36w7u6,Avatar,t3_104g280,t1_j35iu37,1673011952.0
"As a history major I remember many times having the discussion with other students about would you actually wanna live in any time period we were studying and it was almost always 100% no. Visit?

He was put in a very difficult situation. The guy who just claimed had no attachment to him just gave up Kiri to save Spider’s life. He still believes the RDA is evil and that’s y he didn’t go with Quarrich but he at least returned the favor and saved him from drowning. Neytiri needs to be cut slack only in the sense that she lost everything and was still losing things to the sky people. She was having an emotional breakdown. The extended Parents From Hell scene was brutal and I feel like it could’ve worked in the movie,128,kjhw7dr,Avatar,t3_19f7syf,t3_19f7syf,1706187522.0
"Honestly agreed. Yea, he made a pretty questionable (and from his perspective a pretty reluctant) decision at the end of the film, but we know why he made it. Even more so we know that he still fully rejected Quaritch and chose the Sullys/Na’vi over him without a second thought. He chose the people he cares about over the chance at family, which is saying something given his past and Quaritch probably being the only person to call him son and mean it since his bio mom.

And that’s not even getting to all the things he did to protect everyone in A2. From prioritizing everyone’s safety when they were first captured, to being willing to die than give up the location of high camp and the Sullys, pulling every inch of sway over Quaritch to keep the reef clans alive during the raids (no deaths that we know about at all), finding the moment to wreck the sea dragon and likely turning the final battle, burying his emotions after watching his childhood friend die and helping Jake return the sea dragon to rescue Kiri and Tuk, and bargaining for Kiri’s life and not wavering even under Neytiris knife. He made a questionable decision, but his good far outweighs the bad.


Another point, everyone treats Spider like a villain for this, but they forget that a couple of our protagonists have done worse. Neytiri’s trauma, the lines she crossed, and her focusing her output of Spider rather than trying to heal is its own debate within itself. Always, I find it petty hilarious that people treat Spider like the villain when Jake willingly gave Quaritch info for months just to have more time with the Na’vi, which resulted in the destruction of Hometree, easily the loss of about a hundred lives, and near destruction of the tree of souls. He also sat by an was willing to let the reef clans get raided after he was the one to blow their cover hiding, even knowing that Spider, and ally was being dragged along be RDA in the raids, and was also fully willing to risk tulkun lives to stay in hiding for just a little longer. And yes, he redeemed himself for his actions in A1 and became toruk makto, and a lot of his actions in A2 can be defended by protecting his family, but even with that, he’s made worse decisions than everyone in his family/any of his allies. Ending A2 where they did is like splitting A1 at the destruction of Hometree. Anyone would hate Jake a lot more before the next half of the film if that happened.

"Spider is a Child. Spider is a child who did not ask to be on Pandora but also does not deserve the wasteland that is implied to be Earth. Spider is a Child who deserved to be cared for and raised with compassion.

Neytiri is traumatized after the events of the first movie. She lost her home, she lost her father, her sister, Tsu'Tey, her Ikran. She almost lost Jake, someone she loves. She is not who should be raising or interacting with Spider due to her trauma. 

Jake probably sees a lot of himself in Spider. A young and hopeful child, someone who sees the beauty in Pandora. Or maybe he sees a lot of his brother in Spider. I don't think he should be raising or handling Spider either. He's too close to the human issue. 

None of this is Spider's fault though. Him being so close to the Sully's should have been nipped in the bud a lot earlier by his human caretakers. Whether the Sully kids bonded with Spider or not it should not be on Jake and Neytiri to be watching after a Human Child on Pandora.

"He deserves plenty of hate, if only for saving the Quatrich clone's life.  Spider watched him nearly kill those Metkayina while interrogating them on Jake's whereabouts. He killed the ilu just to prove a point that he could and would kill whatever gets in his way.  Spider was nearly in tears when all of this happened and still let that evil fucker live?  He was in tears when humans killed the tulkun and still let the person leading the assault against Pandora live?

I'm sure Spider knows that humans destroyed earth, he knows the RDA will only continue to ravage Pandora, kill the tulkun, and do as they please with complete disregard for all of it... for the flora and fauna of Pandora, for the Navi, the Metkayina, for Eywa, for all of it.

What irks me the most is that he watched Neteyam die at the hands of the RDA and then mourned for him at his funeral, knowing he let that asshole live to regroup with the other assholes to continue their destructive mission.  To continue to destroy his ""adoptive family"", the land and people he seems to love so much.   He has sooooo much love for Kiri, holding her hand as she buried her brother, yet his father killed her mother, his father/the RDA killed Neteyam, and again, he let's that POS live?

Better yet, he wants Neytiri to stop looking at him like he's the demon's spawn?  Bring her the demon's head on a fucking platter and she'll welcome you with open arms.  What better way to get your potential future morher in law's blessing and acceptance?  I  mean, I get it. It's a plot device to continue this interplanetary war, to add to the conflict and give us more films, but come on.  Is there no other villain available?  

If the humans so desperately need a place to live, a planet to run to after they've ravaged their own, you'd think they'd humble themselves and adapt as best as they can to the ways of Pandora.  I want to see that and those challenges after whatever war it is that's coming in part 3.

"You realise that Quaritch dying would stop none of that, right? RDA would still plunder Pandora. They would still kill Na'vi and tulkun. They would hunt Jake and his family since from their perspective he destroyed one of their tulkun hunting ships and killed a lot of people so clearly must be taken out.

This weird conviction that if Quaritch was dead Sully's could go back to their beach vacation life is so weird. This colonisation thing is much bigger than a conflict between two dudes. In A1 killing Quaritch was a big deal because he was the driving force of the conflict but now he's a foot soldier in an invasion and his death is just a write off in the equipment section. Someone not driven by personal grudges might be way more effective.

When I watched the movie I was angry at Jake for not finishing the job (should've broke Quaritch's neck) and I too was saying ""no, no, no"" in my head when Spider turned around and pulled him out of water. I get wanting Quaritch to just die but this take that if only he did they all be safe and Spider somehow doomed them all is kind of ridiculous.

I would even say that the opposite is true since at least now they have leverage (Spider) over someone who is part of the RDA war machine. We all saw Quaritch pulling punches the moment Spider is in danger (not only with Kiri but also when it came to shooting Jake on that rock).

Also, Spider doesn't owe any murdering to Neytiri. Certainly, not to apologise for existing. Spider has not given up them or High Camp under torture, saved more Na'vi lives in this film than Jake did and crashed SeaDragon.

"I never said that Quatrich's death would stop anything from happening.  I never said that they're all doomed because he let him live.  They're not safe, the RDA was coming back regardless.  That wasn’t the point of the post, and that wasn't what my response was about.

I said Spider deserves the hate for seeing firsthand how morally corrupt his ""father"" is (as are 95% of the other RDA humans on pandora) and still letting him live.  And I never said he owes Quatrich's murder to Neytiri, I mentioned that as more of a bonus, something that would definitively earn him points with his potential mother in law.

For someone like Spider who wants to be Navi so hard, who's obviously head over heels for Kiri, he owed it to Pandora, to Eywa, to get rid of that RDA demon when he had the chance. Jake thought he was dead, and yes he dropped the ball by not making sure, but Spider went out of his way to save his life when he could've just kept it pushing and let him drown. 

And Spider may have crashed the sea dragon, but to me, Payakan deserves more of the praise for what he did to get that fight going and change the momentum.  I'd say he probably clocked more kills and saved more lives that day.

Also, I don't know why Quatrich needs to remain such a main character.  James Cameron obviously has plans in place, but like you said, Quatrich's presence and death was a big deal in A1, to me his rescue at the end of A2 was not needed.  Which is why it irks me that he's still alive.... it's unnecessary to move the plot forward with such a hateful character.  Do we really need to recycle the same villain? 

Side note:  the whole decision to have the Sully's leave the forest and join the metkayina to save their family and/or pandora was a stupid and poorly thought out plot device to begin with.  Them leaving was obviously never going to change anything.

"I'm no aircraft engineer, but I think they would have to go thru a very long and expensive jet development program to have a fighter aircraft that handles as expected in the denser atmosphere of Pandora, amidst powerful magnetic currents, against targets that don't behave exactly like the military targets on earth",126,jm0abif,Avatar,t3_13ud3k1,t3_13ud3k1,1685317989.0
"It takes a ludicrous amount of time, money, resources, infrastructure, and manpower to maintain and keep jets in working order. For the cost of maintaining, fueling, and arming one fancy futuristic F-35, they could’ve spent that money and resources on a couple more Samsons or Scorpions. I’ve never done any aircrew or air maintenance stuff but IIRC, rotary aircraft like helicopters are already a pain in the ass to maintain. Imagine overloading the already overworked maintenance crew with fixing a fighter jet. And this also involves spending the time and money to bring in specialist personnel, parts, equipment, infrastructure, and industries needed to train and work on fixing fighter jets. 

You may have noticed that “maintaining”/“maintenance”/etc. is said so often, and there’s a reason for that; aircraft in general require a ton of it. When your jet is flying (much less making fast, constant evasive maneuvers), it’s going to put a ton of strain and stress on all of the individual parts from the canopy and engines down to the individual nuts and bolts holding everything in place. Basically, the primary issue with having fighter jets on Pandora is primarily money and logistics.  

The PR angle also factors in too. Why does a powerful multinational corporation need fighter jets? I just don’t see them acquiring such things because the remaining nation states of earth will feel threatened (and rightfully so). Also, the RDA already has air superiority over their sites; there’s no need to invest the logistics into an answer that’s not needed to the problem.",24,jm0kig7,Avatar,t3_13ud3k1,t3_13ud3k1,1685323059.0

"Others have already commented on the expenses involved in maintaining a fleet of fighter jets on a distant planet, but I would also argue that jets would be completely useless for the RDA's mission on Pandora.

The RDA is not waging an all out war. In fact despite being the villains of the films, the RDA has shown to be mostly defensive and reactionary rather than proactively aggressive. At the start of A2, the RDA is fighting the Omaticaya because Jake keeps leading raids against RDA resources and property. But it's not like they're trying to eradicate all Na'vi - for example the RDA is well aware of the Metkayina and Ta'unui but for the most part left them alone until they believed they were sheltering the Sullys (and before that when they interfered with Tulkun hunting operations).

Jets are useful for 1. bombing stationary targets like military bases and civilian populations (whose locations are well known) that are also heavily armed to the point where helicopters would get easily shot down, and 2. taking down other jets. Thus jets wouldn't work against the Omaticaya, because the RDA doesn't know where Jake's secret base is. Even if the RDA wanted to prepare for potential all-out war against other Na'vi villages, they wouldn't have to take out AA emplacements that would otherwise threaten Kestrels or Samsons, and they wouldn't need to destroy reinforced concrete and metal structures since all Na'vi constructions are made of wood and plant material. Na'avi villages are also usually not large enough to justify carpet bombing. So in regards to bombing runs, jets would be overkill.

Jets would not be able to take out ikran since they are so much faster - even if they used IR or heat-seeking missiles, a jet travels so much faster than an ikran that the jet would easily overshoot and miss.

Keep in mind that the RDA, despite its firepower and military tech, is a corporate security force and not an army. That explains why their strategies are actually pretty bad in some instances, hampered either by a lack of funds or a lack of planning. For instance, at the end of the second film, any competent military would have used scouts and scanning devices to be fully aware of their surroundings, and would have known the Metkayina were on their way before they were even in sight. They also would have detected Payakan fucking around underneath them and taken some evasive or defensive actions, instead of having their multi-billion dollar ship destroyed by a fucking fish.",14,jm1bs6g,Avatar,t3_13ud3k1,t3_13ud3k1,1685338057.0

also, like what others have already said, the RDA doesn’t really have any major uses for them. the airspace over their bases are fine, there’s no issues since the CIWS shred pretty much everything. it’s only when they go on the offensive that they start losing, and that’s because they usually underestimate the Na’vi and frick up everything.",14,jm090qg,Avatar,t3_13ud3k1,t3_13ud3k1,1685317357.0

There were a few plot holes.  If the human were willing to scorch several hundred city blocks are without any care for the inhabitants, they could have scorched more are to eliminate the native threat.

Jets would be incredibly fast, but the planet could simply swarm the sky with flying animals.  Here on earth, human still have to worry about birds getting sucked into jet intakes.

In the current environment, this is no longer possible.

To be very fair though, her son had just been killed, Quaritch was threatening to kill another one, and the overall threat of the humans invading her planet and destroying the things she grows to love had consumed her with fear and rage to a point where the animal warrior took over completely. 

So I think we can maybe excuse that one. Everything else is just part of being a parent. There is no right or wrong or perfect way. The only bad things are the obvious stuff (gaslighting, physical and emotional Abuse, manipulation, neglect, etc).

"One thing I've noticed across several fandoms is that there's always a slice of fans who have it out hardcore for one or two prominent women in a series.

These enlightened geniuses of course think they're entirely rational and intelligent, despite exposing their issues and going off the deep end.

For the Sullies, Jake even says it in one of his internal monologues; ""Sullies stick together. It was our greatest weakness... and our greatest strength."" This man has become INCREDIBLY reckless when it comes to his family; to the point where I firmly place the responsibility of Neteyam's death on his shoulders. For Neytiri, this woman has severe PTSD. I mean, truly severe. She her baby sister murdered by RDA soldiers. The place her clan called home since the time of the first songs callously destroyed and her father killed at the same time. Seze being killed while they were queued(meaning she experienced it with her). Then, watching her son die in her arms because the ghost of the man who destroyed her home and killed her father has come back to haunt her. Especially now, after seeing the deleted scenes and the things included in the extended and collectors editions, it is VERY safe to say, she was experiencing a mental break at this point of the movie. Quaritch's flaws lay in his personal sense of vendetta and his attachment to a child he would have easily abandoned had he not died at the Assault on the Tree of Souls.

THEN when Quaritch tells them ""If you try anything, I will shoot your daughters in the head"" and they proceeded to try attacking when Quaritch only needs 2 seconds to aim his gun at Kiri or Tuktirey's head and pull the trigger.

Payakan attacked first, this gave them an opening cause they were to busy trying not to be crushed by Payakan. They simply took advantage. Quaritch didn't kill them because then he has no leverage to get to Tsyeyk and he couldn't stop the attack cause Tsyeyk was already underwater.

In my whole years of working with kids and their parents – kind explaining won‘t do it and harsh words will neither. Only love language can stay unfiltered. Lo‘ak needed to be seen and loved as he is and that’s the whole reason why he unawarily acted like this. More hugs and active listening from the parents is what opens the ears and the mind of insecure children. But how can you deliver that quality constantly in times of war?

By reckless, I mean I think it's come to the point where this man is willing to go to ridiculous lengths in the pursuit of ""protecting his family"", including leaving the safest place they could have been(yeah the Resistance and the RDA are fighting almost non-stop some time after the Sullies arrive in Awa'atlu, but like he pointed out in 1, they had the home field advantage, and they had tech and weapons now too, which would have given them an even greater advantage), to willingly handing himself over. Had Payakan not been there for Lo'ak, Jake would have ended up dead, alongside his kids, and the Metkayina. His recklessness in trying to be a superhero and taking his family out of the Hallelujah Mountains, or even the forest itself, is what put Neteyam and the kids in the predicaments they were in.

Yes, and he didn't shoot him cause that isn't their goal. They need to get to Tsyeyk and let's be honest, Quaritch does not want to tick off Neytiri unnecessarily. If he kills the kids then he has no leverage and is surrounded my Na'vi ready to destroy them.

It does matter this communicator hasn't bee shown to work underwater. How is he to communicate with Tsyeyk on his skimwing? Who is moving in and out of water quickly. Why exactly does he want to attack? Cause his kids are being held hostage. This scenario happens in a lot of films and the parents are never deemed bad parents, just parents who want to save their kids. Why is the scenario now bad?

Because the information Jake has is ""If you try to attack us, we will shoot your son in the head"". If you were a parent and a bad guy had a gun to your child's head and he told you ""If you try to attack us, we will shoot your son in the head"", would you still attack him?

">Would you do the same if your children were being held hostage?

Yes. Some distraction, either myself or someone else and then an attack from behind or them being swarmed. With a distraction like Payakan, I would go for it. Doesn't make me a bad parent.

>Look at this solely from Jake and Neytiri's perspectives.

OK, from Tsyeyk's perspective. 
My kids are in danger. Someone has caused damage to the enemy and disorientated them. While they are distracted, attack don't let anyone stop me till my child is safe. He needs me so he won't hurt my kids. If I do end up dead, or my kid dies, my wife will kill them, and the clan will back her.

>Doesn't matter. Jake and Neytiri don't know this.

Yes, it does, and yes, they do. The conversation between Neytiri and Quaritch let them know that Quaritch knows what Neytiri is capable of when her loved ones are in danger. He saw when Quaritch tried to kill Tsyeyk and when their kids were kidnapped. She is deadly and very skilled. And they know that they have Quaritch cornered. That ship is surrounded by Metkayina, and their member was on the ship. It wouldn't end well for them to kill a hostage.",1,jrsqiar,Avatar,t3_14xnrnz,t1_jrso8qj,1689253236.0

Sorry but you are a bad parent gambling with your child's life - in this scenario, the distraction is: your kid has a gun to their head, a whale jumps up and goes back in the water, you charge screaming and yelling head on and the bad guy sees you coming and then pulls out his gun and shoots your child in the head because you decided to openly attack. That's what Jake did.

The second scenario, there are 20 bad guys and your children are being held hostage. You toss grenade, immediately alerting every enemy to your active assault on their forces; the bad guy closest to your children immediately pulls a gun and shoots one of your children and holds the other close to them as a hostage. Congratulations, you, after announcing your open assault on the enemies with a grenade explosion, have indirectly killed your child all because you decided to bring the wrath of hell with you.

Go back and watch the scene. Payakan jumps up, Jake charges, Payakan disappears, Jake and the Metkayina charge head on (screaming and yelling), Quaritch is standing right behind Lo'ak still completely fine (not disoriented) and it would only take him 2 seconds to pull a gun.

Which is it? Does Jake consider Quaritch a threat to his kids or not? If he does consider him a threat, he is playing a very risky game with his children' lives by openly attacking the person who said ""If you attack me or my guys, I will kill one of your children"". If he does not consider him a threat, why does every scene in the movie show him treating Quaritch as though he could seriously harm his kids?",1,jrsuw0t,Avatar,t3_14xnrnz,t1_jrsqiar,1689255264.0
">your kid has a gun to their head, a whale jumps up and goes back in the water, 

Then, the gun is no longer at the kids' head. And they probably emptied the gun on said whale who is actively attacking.

>You toss grenade, immediately alerting every enemy to your active assault on their forces; the bad guy closest to your children immediately pulls a gun and shoots one of your children and holds the other close to them as a hostage.

That simply won't work like that. Who would toss a grenade in their own general area. This isn't even similar to their situation because the ""grenade"" took out half the bad guys and destroyed parts of the vessel that the bad guys are on as well as cause the bad guys to empty clips into it. It's not that simple. And shooting the kid would cause Tsyeyk to lose control of the Metkayina. Their princess is on the ship, too. Once shots are fired, it is an active war zone. You don't stand around and wait to be shot.

>Go back and watch the scene. Payakan jumps up, Jake charges, Payakan disappears, Jake and the Metkayina charge head on (screaming and yelling), Quaritch is standing right behind Lo'ak still completely fine (not disoriented) and it would only take him 2 seconds to pull a gun.

Quaritch was also fighting/shooting Payakan. Cause he was actively swinging at people. Yes, they charged while the RDA side was recovering from the surprise attack. His gun was already pulled, but how is he supposed to stop the attack. Tsyeyk had already died. His goal is Tsyeyk, killing Lo'ak at that time is of no use to Quaritch.  Tsyeyk is also Marine trained. He would know how this protocol would work. He would know that Quaritch just needs leverage. He lost it when the attack commenced. 

>Which is it? Does Jake consider Quaritch a threat to his kids or not? If he does consider him a threat, he is playing a very risky game with his children' lives by openly attacking the person who said ""If you attack me or my guys, I will kill one of your children"". If he does not consider him a threat, why does every scene in the movie show him treating Quaritch as though he could seriously harm his kids?

I'm saying he knows Neytiri is a threat. Tsyeyk and Neytiri know that he sees Neytiri as a threat. I never said Quaritch wasn't a threat. I'm saying Quaritch is aware of how much of a threat to his life it is to kill that kid in front of Neytiri. It's like a Mexican stand-off. Quaritch has the kids -> Tsyeyk has the Metkayina ready -> Neytiri could snipe Quaritch if the kids are injured and the Metkayina attack -> but they are stoppedQuaritch having the kids. Payakan attacking broke the Mexican stand-off, and shots were fired. It's a war zone now. And they fight. 

Only terrible parents would leave their kids in that situation and not try and save them. 

Let's just agree to disagree. This isn't going anywhere. You have points, I have points, and we clearly can't agree on while I've enjoyed the mental work, we probably both have better things to do. Thank you for your time.",1,jrsxldu,Avatar,t3_14xnrnz,t1_jrsuw0t,1689256444.0

"I’m Native Hawaiian and that’s 100% exactly what I was thinking about. It’s disheartening (though not at all unexpected) to see people in this thread see this as a happy ending just because the, to quote the preshow, “bad mining practices” on Pandora have stopped. However, a lot of people don’t really realize the effects of being designated and promoted as a “paradise” tourist destination are devastating on an ecological, economical, and cultural level. Please forgive all the comparisons to Hawai’i that will follow, it's by no means isolated to those islands however it is where I have the most knowledge to make these comparisons.
 
 Just on Hawai’i alone the infrastructure to build and maintain the tourism industry has not only consumed a ton of resources its actively inhibiting the ability of the land and water to heal and replenish because of the continued need to maintain it. Hawaii was once capable of watering and feeding a population of hundreds of thousands of people thanks to careful and thoughtful Indigenous land and water management. Now a huge amount of the food is imported and so, so much of the fresh water is literally being poisoned as I type this. That’s a place where the tourists can breathe the air, eat the food and drink the water with ease. But on Pandora? The infrastructure to maintain colonies and lodge tourists will be exponentially higher and the risk of failure or catastrophe of that infrastructure exponentially higher as well. While these things, as all things, can in theory be managed the data shows us that the land is at its healthiest and most robust when managed by the Indigenous people who live there (80% of the world’s biodiversity is cared for and protected by Indigenous people who make up less than 5% of the population. This isn’t to say being Indigenous automatically makes someone innately know better than non-Indigenous people—for example I grew up not just urban but in America I have a few non-Indigenous friends in Hawaii who know Indigenous land management better than me and I would defer to them immediately. What I mean is the knowledge and implementation of the practices.) However I have many doubts that the Na’vi are able to manage and maintain the lands that Alpha-Centuri has settled on. My doubts are primarily based on the limited information we have on this future generations down the line, but as far as I can tell all members of Alpha-Centuri are human. In Hawai’i, things are very slowly and painfully getting better with the rise of Hawaiian sovereignty and slowly growing support for using Indigenous, rather than Western, methodology for land management and also scientific advancement. I don’t recall mention or sight of a single Na’vi scientist or of any Na’vi scientific practices and thought being implemented in Alpha-Centuri’s operations, which leads me to believe that the Na’vi are ultimately still being treated as basically intelligent animals to be observed and interacted with rather than fully sapient and capable people to be learned from and shared with. If they’re not learning from and sharing with the people who know how to tend to the environment, than intentionally or not they will be creating more problems and disasters simply because they do not have the knowledge to avoid those mistakes nor do they understand the methods that have been adopted to ensure that advancement does not lead to destruction.
 
I’m going to kind of combine the economical concerns with the cultural ones, as economics is admittedly one of my weaknesses and I’m not confident in giving one to one examples when part of the reason Hawai’i adopted capitalism was to trade not just with one other nation but a host of other nations and I don’t know how that translates to a universe where I don’t know how many habited planets are known and are trading with each other. However, another reason I believe that the Na’vi are not in charge of managing tourism or even equal partners in the Alpha-Centuri operation is, as we’ve stated, the commodification of the culture. A few of the comments in this thread seem to think that sharing culture means that everything about the culture should be readily available to humans once they’ve learned to stop blowing shit up and mindlessly killing. However, things like the iknimaya are not just a fun little quirk of the forest Na’vi but a spiritual and religious act marking not just adulthood but a full affirmation of one’s place in the clan. It’s communing with Eywa. It’s forming a sacred bond and a partnership that is more than just saddling up an earth horse. I’m going to make a thread about dreamwalkers/recoms/avatars later now that I’m on this tangent, but essentially there’s no way that Na’vi would be fine with allowing aliens with no connection to Eywa beyond finding her neat and pretty to not just skinwalk as one of them but to allow those skinwalkers to subject ikran to a bond with a soulless husk so that a deeply intimate connection can be hijacked for thrills. That screams coercion to me. That screams a suppression of life and culture. Ive ranted long enough even though I have more to say, but essentially this ending and the people who see it as a happy one has reminded me that while a lot of fans will say they really connected with the ecological message of the movie, all that really landed with them is “oh wow pretty trees” and no actual reflections on the destruction inherent to the unchecked desire to consume.",74,j9uiqzo,Avatar,t3_11arpe7,t1_j9txrie,1677260056.0
"It's basically a ""Capitalism"" problem. The only real way for humanity to exist peacefully is to eliminate the system that only exists to exploit others for profit. Such coercive hierarchy will always result in oppression, either the openly violent kind seen so far in the films or the more ""subtle"" version implied by the Disney park.

The big question will be does Cameron have the ""clout"" to produce a movie with such a radical message.

The Māori of New Zealand at least got more respect, and are mostly integrated with the colonial people. To the point that they are far more open to the culture that came to their shores. Also the fact that New Zealanders take/toke the steps to actually symbiotically coexist with the Māori people and not genocide the culture out of the nation’s collective memory is an additional bonus.

And I also feel the same way as you. Commodifying a culture and exploiting it for that sweet sweet green, is much the same as putting a genocidal end to its memory. Much like America has to just about any and all Native Indigenous cultures it has encountered. Only it was genocide first, commodify later.

"There's an intersection between the park lore and historical context that I think could have been a little more carefully considered. 

That said, it seems to me that ending up like Hawaii and similar requires the key step of human societal dominion over the Na'vi, and I'm not sure that's a conclusion we can firmly draw. My read on the park and what we know of the sequels is that on Pandora we'll just see a partial repeat of the first film's ending, with Pandora and the Na'vi winning the contest of force and driving out the RDA. Like before, a small group will stay with permission and be supplemented by some minor transit to and from Pandora and Earth.

It's a bit of an awkward fit considering the reality of the colonial legacy that Avatar plays off of, but I don't really see the alternatives where the Na'vi lose agency to the extent of other colonial victims as something that are compatible with the relationship between humans and Na'vi suggested by the park.

"The humans are selling the tickets however there is no way for there to be an activity for them to sell tickets for without the Naʻvi being active participants in the sale of their own culture, which only happens from a mix of devestation, desperation, and oppression brought on by colonialism. The implications are essentially that the Naʻvi have had the management of their land and lives wrested from them by hook or by crook and have little other options to survive. Im not 100% sure how to explain it in a broad sense but the closest i can think of is if humanity started selling marriage to aliens, but I dont just mean the concept i mean imagine that aliens have created human skins to walk around in and we forced X amount of people to be basically ""tourist spouses"" and those people are forced to go through a wedding ceremony and the intimate act of the wedding night on repeat with the same body but different strangers in it. Thats the closest way i can think of to what this would be to the Naʻvi who form the spiritual and neural connection to their ikran. Its also a declaration and celebration of their connection to Eywa, their ability to form that bond.

Imo, and I don’t mean to dismiss your thoughts pardon me if I come across as rude, but I believe that there are better realistic outcomes. Humanity has been able to live in harmony with nature before and in some places still does today through careful land management and practice-based methodology (Indigenous people who practice Indigenous land management on their homelands protect 80% of the world's biodiversity despite being less than 5% of the population according to a study from a few years ago).

"> this attitude … gives an anti-immigrant message  
> If a human being is pure of heart and action towards Pandora, the Na’vi, and Eywa … they should be accepted by the society to integrate within the Na’vi culture 

Agreed! But that’s also the entire point of the film. Jake fell in love with the people and the culture so much that he assimilated, to the point he leaves behind his human body to become Na’vi permanently. We saw the same with Grace, too, after they accepted her back. I’m not sure how you could possibly come away thinking that the film or fandom fosters any anti-immigrant sentiment.

The Na’vi way of life is *very* different to the humans’, though. It’s not for everyone, so people who aren’t fully prepared to make a real commitment shouldn’t be allowed to experience the most sacred parts of their culture as part of a vacation package. ***That*** is what people are against.

We know of countless indigenous tribes in other countries who do not utilize any kind of technology to this day. 

I personally wonder about these laws, why they would be so dangerous if the Na’vi continued to stay connected to Eywa and each other and didn’t use it against each other there’d be no issue. Yes I know it could be argued the invention of such technologies set us into the age of very early communism and such, and “oh you have a stone home but I don’t so I’ll kill you for it” but so long as the Na’vi don’t create currency and again continue to be connected to their roots so to speak I couldn’t see it being an issue.

"Oooookay now we are walking into actual whacko territory 

I'm gonna assume naturalism means you didn't get vaccinated... if that's the case you and your family are MEGA lucky because if one mild strain of measles walks in you are gonna find yourself 2,000 dollars and 1-3 family members lighter because I can't imagine this wouldn't go well for you

"Naturalism means we live more in tune with nature like drinking straight from any body of water if we are thirsty as well as not going to the hospital unless we are literally dying not vaccinating is also a thing we do but that's cause we view vaccines as a joke such is the results when you're natural immunity is so high.

 Bet I won't cause the measles as also a joke my family laughed at. 
Infact that is how viruses work it's called evolution viruses need a host if the host has a weak immunity the virus will be able to survive and spread to more hosts. Some are stronger hosts and make more of a challenge to survive for the viruses as a result they evolve to be a little stronger. This keeps going on forever or until the virus dies off. If the host is weaker than the virus the host dies if the host is equal to the virus the host lives but will have to fight the virus and may end up dead.  If the host is stronger than the virus the virus will die. Before vaccines the weak immunity people would die leaving more people with a higher immunity to breed making the gene pool stronger from viruses. However now that vaccines are a thing weaker immunity people have a higher chance of surviving leaving their weaker immunity in the gene pool. And while the weaker people are surviving the weaker viruses are not, leaving the stronger ones to multiply. This in turn makes the virus more deadly over time as the virus is still evolving but humanity's immunity has stalled because the weaker immune people survived to have kids that also have weak immune systems. This in turn makes it easier for the virus to infect the host each generation.",1,kgitmxq,Avatar,t3_18zc40v,t1_kgil8wv,1704504667.0

"Dude, what fan fiction are you reading? The last thing RDA wants is to solve the global energy crisis they’re literally profiting off of. If you read the Guide book or Wiki, you’ll learn how RDA deliberately sabotages research into the artificial synthesis of Unobtainium so they can maintain their monopoly on the market. **RDA doesn’t give af about humanity, only their bottom line.** There’s research Augustine and other scientists were doing about the plant life and biomes on Pandora and how they could help heal diseases on Earth and restore the atmosphere but RDA doesn’t fund this research because there’s no profit in it.  In fact the only reason there’s an Avatar Program in the first place was because they originally planned to ~~enslave~~ recruit the Na’vi as mine workers and they wanted the Avatars to work as supervisors. As it is, they’re slow killing the human mine workers who work under horrible conditions and are cycled back home with compromised health and die shortly after. 

u/Slopeydodd got it right - RDA set up a vicious cycle where the more Unobtainium they mined, the more they use to power their interstellar travelling (that’s one of RDA’s primary use for the substance as well as maglev transportation) and the more Unobtainium they can extract to fund and fuel that journey ad nauseum. They’re doing what every mega crop does - chasing after as high a profit margin as possible. 

They don’t give af about humanity and if they’re terraforming Pandora to set up an Earth colony, you can bet your bottom dollar that the only people boarding those lifeboats off Earth will be the 1% that afford the ticket.

"This is what the wiki says about the uses of Unobtainium:

>To humans, however, unobtanium has become the backbone of Earth's economy. As a powerful energy conductor, unobtanium has countless specialized uses. Notably, it is vital to Superluminal Communications and the manufacturing of computer hyperchips. It is also essential for running the RDA's global high-speed maglev train system on Earth.[10] Perhaps most importantly, unobtanium facilitates the containment and direction of energy in the matter-antimatter annihilation system which propels ships like the ISV Venture Star, enabling them to travel at incredibly fast speeds and reach the Alpha Centauri system in as little as ~6 years.

>Thusly, without unobtanium, interstellar commerce on a massive scale would not be possible. Unobtanium is not only the key to Earth’s energy needs in the 22nd century but the enabler of interstellar travel and the establishment of a truly spacefaring civilization. This creates a feedback loop: The more unobtanium is mined, the more ships can be built and the more equipment can be sent to Pandora for further mining.

"I'm getting tired of people calling out the actors' age gap as a reason why the characters can't develop a romance.

You can absolutely depict a romance without the need for overt physical intimacy. It can be verbal. They can hold hands or lean on each other. They don't need to actually kiss onscreen for a romantic relationship to be developed.

TWOW shows they're already very close, arguably more so than any of the Sully kids are with each other. They play with and tease each other. There are several shots of either character silently looking at the other for extended periods of time. In real life, this doesn't have to amount to anything.

I think she is beginning to realize her potential and her true connection to Pandora, and by the end of the movie she has more courage and resolve, especially when she helps Tuk and Neytiri. She seems more in control of the situation than she would have at the beginning of TWoW when she was more fragile, and more of a follower (Tuk is basically the only one who sort of follows Kiri's lead, but she's the youngest).

Spider changes a lot. He begins to soften toward the idea of Quaritch being his father, and even saves his life. That is huge for someone who seems ashamed to be human at all.

End of the day? I don't agree that these two characters have NO ARC, and I would vehemently disagree that they don't change at all.",7,j0vi7vc,Avatar,t3_zpajdt,t3_zpajdt,1671476318.0
"I doubt it will ever be romantic considering the actress who plays Kiri is 74 and the actor who plays spider is 21 I think. I think it will end in friendship only. 

As for the spider arc neyitiri is really hypocritical considering Jake was human now Na’vi. And spider is kinda like a mini him. Someone who just wants to be apart of the culture.",6,j0tda9c,Avatar,t3_zpajdt,t3_zpajdt,1671433057.0

"While I can see the ""romance"" vibe to the relationship, I also see more of a ""union between humanity and Na'vi"" message going on that doesn't necessarily need to include romance. They ""see"" one another and connect spiritually, bridging the gap between their parents and species. 

Jake and Neytiri have shades of this, but Spider and Kiri are ""purer"" than either of them. 

Spider is the clearest proof that humanity is not ""by nature"" evil. Yes, Jake, Norman, and the rest have joined the Na'vi, but Spider seems to embrace the culture with a much purer zeal. He shows that when raised outside of human morals, humans can ""become one of the people"".

He and Kiri in my mind work almost as the purest ""union"" of human and Na'vi (though there is a discussion to be had about white coded Grace becoming the purest indigenous person....but she did literally die and be reborn so it is a complex discussion). They represent an almost innocent joining of the two people, able to support each other completely. 

Kiri already carries a ton of religious symbolism from her birth, but further down the line she and Spider could become the ""Adam and Eve"" as it were of the united Human-Na'vi relationship.",5,j0uyf8p,Avatar,t3_zpajdt,t3_zpajdt,1671468599.0

"I agree.

While I still feel like TWOtW is my favorite film of the two (honestly the whales had a lot to do with that) - I did not appreciate Generation Z mannerisms being introduced suddenly (sorry). My best guess, as someone who's a great deal older than younger kids in their teens/20's who love this film, is that Cameron really wanted to draw you guys in. I think he was deeply concerned about not connecting emotionally/spiritually to younger audiences. Its clear that he wanted you guys to feel you could ""relate"" to the teenage drama aspect of the film.

Some of the things I really didn't like was the use of ""earth slang"" of human Generation Z.. like *""SICK""*... I'm sorry, but the Na'vi would not be saying ""SICK"" as a means of ""COOL"" on Pandora. It isn't realistic or even remotely plausible. Still, I tried to look past this as it was very clear to me that Cameron just wanted to reach out to this generation and welcome them into the Avatar world of ***SOUL*** contemplation and dare I say spiritual truth. He wants you all to contemplate what life COULD be like if you opened your hearts up to it. But he knows he must ""speak your language"" a little bit if he's to truly catch your attention. Or at least that's what he thought he had to do. That's my opinion.

He definitely over-humanized their mannerisms in this film far more than he did in the last film.

Overall, I think he did an exceptional job really reaching out to younger audiences and drawing them into new ideas about the genuine nature of the soul/spirit. Many younger audiences aren't even contemplating their own souls these days because they're so lost in social media and a superficial/artificial existence. They were *born into it.* They're more concerned about the newest ""cloud skin"" makeup technique than waking up spiritually. I can only hope this film will encourage younger people to begin researching metaphysical books and learning about a new world they didn't know existed.",3,j3n8yb8,Avatar,t3_1072j5v,t3_1072j5v,1673291644.0

"You know that would’ve been a great way to highlight cultural differences between the Metkyen and Ometycia and also give us a scene of characterisation between Neytiri and Kate Winslet’s character. 

For example, Neytiri didn’t want to leave the Forrest, but was in full support of her mates decision to take the family to the Metkyen. This demonstrates there’s a more patriarchal structure to Ometycia society than the Metkyen. 

If we were also lead to belief Jake was planning on going back to the forest alone after the family settled, and this provided some tension between Jake and Neytiri, allowing us to see a conflicted side of Neytiri between her cultural values and her desire to fight the sky people, while learning from the Metkyen’s Zarheek, a new way of family and community values that can accommodate her conflicted feelings, I think it would’ve made for a more complete and interesting family story.

Jake called him Tonowari without having been introduced and the Metkayina clearly knew about Jake’s exploits as Toruk Macto.

Specially since Neytiri seems to act neutral with every other humans like the scientist, and that her husband is a human himself.

You are also disregarding the facts of several situations.

His ""reason"" for the job is clearly to continue doing this violence, not benefiting the RDA(ie the general Capitalist system exploiting Pandora and Earth) or ""humanity""(general populace that people keep using as a tool to show that the RDA is doing all of this for the ""right"" reasons) as a whole.",3,jrb6pnj,Avatar,t3_14uywgp,t3_14uywgp,1688929711.0

"I will say in his defense.

At the start of the film one of the first things Jake sees as he leaves the transport is an RDA dump truck with arrows embedded in it, this heavily implies that there is already some insurgency between the Na'vi and humans, while the film doesn't exactly focus on it, there's clearly combat and continued harassment of the Sec-ops occurring.

With this in mind, the Colonel's actions could be put in a somewhat more understandable light if he were under the assumption that the Omatakaya were involved in the attacks against the RDA.

* Hometree is not just the home of the peaceful Omatakaya clan, it's also possibly providing shelter and aid to insurgents, possibly for years, given the limited intel they have on the Na'vi and lack of trust, it's not an illogical conclusion.
* The Colonel has been watching as his men are killed, yet has not been granted permission to strike back because corporate executives still think this can be resolved peacefully despite the fact that until Jake met with the Omatakya there was no diplomacy possible at all.
* The Colonel's retaliation on Hometree gives him some form of satisfaction instead of horror because he's finally able to strike back against an insurgency that has been killing his soldiers for years, and he gave them some warning and an opportunity to evacuate, both before he opened fire, and when Parker sent Jake and Grace. They had time to get women and children out, yet instead attempted to use lethal force against his non-lethal measures. It was ineffective, but we know that Na'vi arrows CAN punch through the glass from the correct angle and the intentions of the Na'vi was made clear.

Perhaps this doesn't justify his actions, but it puts them into a more sympathetic light if it was seen by him as just one more act in a continuing war instead of as an unprovoked and sudden assault.",3,jrcrpwk,Avatar,t3_14uywgp,t3_14uywgp,1688955776.0

The thing is Quaritch was barely in the movie until Jake betrayed him thats when he really started to go down a spiral. He never outright targeted the Na'vi cus he was wanted to. He felt betrayed by Jake as Jake was someone he trusted and looked out for and even offered to pay for his surgery. Another thing I heard is someone say Quaritch had no redeeming qualities. WTF.

"He’s not evil. The amount of times I’ve seen redditors say they would kill someone if their loved one or mother was ever hurt like in some of the videos here on other subreddits makes it clear that he is simply just human. And humans are the problem in the movie. 

Their dangerous behavior and lack of regard for the well being of life and nature, yet their level of social intellect and technological understanding, essentially describes us here on the internet now, in this exact thread. Imagine all the nature destroyed, trashed, and utterly defiled just so we can talk on our phones and computers. The amount of life deprived and how blissfully ignorant we are of it. 

Now we are literally dehumanizing Quaritch, saying he is evil, and obviously thus deserves to die, be punished, etc for what he has done. 

We are as evil as he is in many ways, and yet we would like to think we are not like him. We like to think that we are the good ones. We can’t be the evil ones… right? 

I imagine Quaritch thinks the same exact thing.

This is what makes the movie spiritual, because we know deeply there is a part of us that is beyond human. Whatever it may be, I hope Quaritch finds it.

Like to the general public. 

We don't understand how to understand a movie like this.
Everything we're taught to support and be proud of is evil, the kinds of people we call heroes are war criminals, and the protagonists are strange people from a far off land who speak a strange language, kill the ""villains"" with no remorse and the main hero is a traitor.

Like, Avatar is known as the movie where the ""guy fucks a blue alien"" because the rest of the story just can't get through. Our cultural blinders are on too strong. 

This movie came out while the Iraq War was still going on, just a 10 months after Bush was president.

The kind of shit Quaritch does is the exact thing our soldiers and Generals and politicians do. The same shit we make excuses for.

Because we don’t understand war or its consequences here.

Ok ok I respect that.

"Having personally worked in fields that have a lot of stress and deal with some of morbid things, disassociating is something I found myself doing a lot. Like a lot. Becoming numb over time and to my circle sometimes noticeably different. I imagine that the combat that Quaritch fought in, just like Jake (notice how even whenever anyone dies or is found dead by Jake, he doesn't cry he taps into his 1000 yard stare) they learned a survival mechanism to separate themselves.

"You're benefiting from it today aren't you? There good and bad in everything. In the case of the Avatar franchise it's conflicting bc us as humans if this all goes to shit and we all die but there's a sliver of hope, I feel like a lot of our opinions on doing questionable things begin to change. Of course not now there's no pressure for us, we'll empathize and are willing to be a sacrificial lamb for something that isn't ""us"". It's mostly due to the fact that many of us in first world nations are incredibly spoiled compared to past generations. But again in the case of Avatar, humanity is screwed bc of its vices and needs a way out. OP said it as well, Quaritch definitely isn't a saint nor hero, he's doing his job out of the needs for his cause and his side, there's little room to be considerate of ""feelings"" when the going really gets tough. 

On the other hand, I feel like this is the discussion Jim wants us to have it's not ""the white colonizer at it again"" or ""capitalism suckz"" that everyone screams on twitter. It's the fact that we can continue to live in a capitalistic world where we can continue to grow (due to the whole aim of an theoretical infinite demand of growth) and monitor it better, instead of pleasing the careless investors, bringing back the focus on the betterment of society. Separating the mess that is politics, taking away the dirty and clean money from the ones that run our legislations and economy and benefit from, and their grossly massive greed/egos to focus on our world. Cleaning up the mess and to prevent the futuristic dystopian world we're heading towards or the end of it.

I understand that as well, but they brought their own suffering and now are make the Na'vi pay. And he is helping. The money they waste trying to kill Na'vi could be spent finding alternative sources or uninhabited planets with the same metal.

I don't think it's the same tbh. Chickens are not on the same level of sentience as humans, and they would sooner go extinct from cannibalism if left to their own devices. And we aren't invading their planet. 
Na'vi are on the same level of sentience and their planet is being invaded, their culture and people exterminated (according to the visual dictionary [the Olangi clan no longer exist because of the battlein A1, the survivors have been taken in by the other clans, namely the Omatikaya] and the Frontiers game, their kids kidnapped and brainwashed).

"I think the better way to view this, is the ACAB argument. It isn’t the individual, but rather, the job they’re having to do, that is evil. 

When the US Military was rounding up Native Americans and slaughtering everyone who fought back, they didn’t see what they were doing, as evil, although it undoubtedly WAS. 
They were simply “doing the job” they were tasked with, from the US Government.

Same thing at Standing Rock/DAPL. The police, military, and fireman, were just doing what they were told, even though it was breaking treaties, their bosses paid them VERY well to do what they were doing. 

The true crime, is keeping the entire population in submission, by keeping the armed law enforcement BARELY above the rest of us. Just enough for them to feel like society is fair, but not enough to allow them the space to breath and see things how they really are. 

A cop will do what he/she is told, because they also have to pay bills and put food on the table.

They have a job that they’re paid to do. It just so happens that their job, is to tell a bunch of natives to “fuck off so we can take all your natural resources” 
That’s an impossible job that only ever ends in violence. 

I get where you’re coming from, but it’s so much deeper than that. Even during WW2, people upheld their bravery, by fighting the help the persecuted until their final breath. 

It’s the difference of dying fighting against the Nazis, or complying for the sake of your own safety, as well as the safety of those you love. 

Women were persecuted MUCH more harshly AFTER the war, for doing Anything That helped the nazis, even though it was just their survival instincts. Even worse, they were persecuted by men who did the same exact thing, but they pointed the finger to keep the blame off of themselves. 

Some people are helpless in all of these situations. You can only do the best you know how.

It’s a very complicated moral dilemma for some people. For others, it seems more straightforward, because their moral compass defines their very being. 

Over the next few films, I think Quaritch’s moral compass is gonna start spinning. Waking up, was much easier from Jakes POV. He was already at the bottom, because of his disability.
Quaritch has only just begun his fall, and he will face trials that change him. 

Quaritch is going to represent the far-right wing, waking up to the true nature of reality.

You should not write off shit like that as “whelp, they’re aliens, it can’t be helped”.

Jake forced nothing, and was infact the man at fault for the Omatikayas suffering. 
Yes, he presumably took advantage of the story inorder for the Omatikaya/clans to be willing to listen to him, but Jake was fighting FOR the NaVi. He did just what the first Toruk Makto did and gathered the clans against a common enemy.
  - Again, do not insert your presumptions. The only hints of religion in the NaVi are Eywa and the whole thing with water. The Toruk Makto tale did not indicate in any possible way that the original was somehow sent by Eywa.

-

Jake was a spy, intended to convince the Omatikaya to move for the benefit of the RDA to directly violate one of the laws all if not almost every NaVi clan obeys. (How would Jake explain that away anyways?)


You think the NaVi were more of a threat to Hellsgate than the soldiers are to the NaVi?? No! Jakes side was fucking losing, big time. Even an army would not have been a threat to any Hellsgate employee .

Jake Sully hears of a legend about a warrior uniting the tribes, a spiritual leader if you will, and when he gets kicked out for betraying the tribe he was spying on and earning the respect for, he decides to take his banshee and go get one of those dragons to become the warrior sent by Eywa to get back in. AND THEN USES HIS POSITION TO AMASS THE TRIBES.

"“We’re in a way better spot than the last 3 generations” in what way? Financially? People in their 30s who went to college can’t afford a house or kids. Emotionally? Depression rates are higher than they’ve ever been. 


“No hanging people for being poc or gay or a promiscuous woman” Also false. They’re not as regular anymore but they absolutely still happen. LGBT and poc people across the board are still much more likely to be victims of violence. Systematic racism has endured, causing many poc communities to still be in poverty. Trans black women in particular have it incredibly tough and are disproportionately more likely to be victims of homicide or violent crime. 


“No laws protecting cold blooded actual hate crime/murders” Also false. Stand your ground laws make it incredibly easy for a person to get away with murder. Also take a look at some rape cases that involve pastors. A lot of the time they’ll be let off with a very minor punishment because “he’s a man of god”. Also look at any politician charged with a crime. Or any cop who kills someone on the job. Gets two weeks payed vacation while the precinct he works for “investigates”. It’s kinda staggering how little you know about the corruption in the justice system. 


“A lot less thirsty and starving kids” okay, where? Food stamp usage has gone up exponentially in the last few years, schools are trying to take away free lunches for kids in poverty, sometimes the only food families can afford is cheap and unhealthy fast food, and even that has gone off the rails from inflation. Food insecurity is starting to climb again as of 2021.

Two answer two questions in one: How am I getting the movies wrong by pointing out the evils of humanity and the flaws the Na’vi are inheriting by following Jake’s lead? And how am I not applying critical thinking when it is plain as day most of the people working for the RDA are doing for a paycheck, while the true psychopaths became Recoms because that’s all they know, and that they’re putting the lives over billions of people back home over the lives of indigenous peoples that are even human, and can’t be integrated into human society for obvious reasons? 

Like the movies showed, you can push the RDA so many times, but since money and lives are on the line, they’re gonna come back in force till either side is dead.

As for the suicide thing: You’re so anti human you make it seem the only logical path humanity, all our history, every life living in Avatar’s universe should die out for the sake of Pandora. 

Exhibit A of a lower tech tier tribe sending colonists packing, the Zulu war against the British I believe. Feel free to correct me. Came in mass, died a lot, still pushed em out like a dry turd.

Aside from that, Toruk Makto has yet to lead all the world's tribes to the conference of tribal linguistics that would need to take place for a solution to this ""problem"" to be decided in a manner fair to everyone, and our understanding of tribal social structures is centuries old and yet still constantly evolving.

The ISVs sent to Pandora presumably use a laser sail from the Earth part of the journey to Pandora, which is in the Alpha Centauri system 4.3 light years away.

I assume these laser sails get the photon power from the Sun or something else, which would have to be extremely energetic since each ISV is thousands of tons massive.

If the RDA or humanity really was thinking right, they could use this energy to power their entire infrastructure for possibly *millions of years*. A bonus would be reterraforming the Earth and colonizing other planets and moons in the Solar System.

"I'm very much on the ""humans destroyed earth now we should just die off on it"" plan because earth WILL survive if our species went extinct. And it'll happen pretty slowly. We'll eventually reach the limit where there are simply too many people to sustain and we'll start dying off from disease, starvation, or the terrifying amount of natural disasters lately. Earth IS fighting back and of course not all of us deserve that and maybe if we don't fuck the earth up too much in the process there'll be a few left capable of treating whatever is left with enough respect to continue on.

"> You’re telling me you couldn’t colonize any other planet that can support life?

There are only two known planets that can support life in the Avatar universe: Pandora and Earth.

Mars, Venus or Europa can absolutely not support life. Mars has 1% of the atmospheric density required for human blood to not start boiling at minus fourty degrees celcius. Venus' atmosphere is dense and hot enough at the surface to melt lead, and if you go high enough in the atmosphere that its density and temperature aren't immediately lethal, then you run into the problem that it's highly toxic and corrosive (much more so than Pandora).

Now while there are potentially areas on Europa that might be amicable to Earth life, this is only aquatic life. The surface of ~~Pandora~~ Europa is a vacuum, no atmosphere, and is constantly blasted by high energy particles accelerated to near light speeds by Jupiter's magnetic field. The only shelter against that is to get under the multi kilometer thick ice caps of Europa.

By comparison, to survive on Pandora you don't even need to wear long sleeves, just a breather mask. It's orders of magnitudes easier to survive on Pandora than it is on Venus, Mars, or Europa.",2,kpmexck,Avatar,t3_1amazzw,t1_kpkutxh,1707478697.0

"We have always dealt with war, natural disasters and diseases. But none of those are as much of a problem as they were in the past.

The main difference between the two films is that Princess Mononoke advocates for sustainable industry that stays in balance with nature, whereas Avatar condemns industrialism in its entirety and instead promotes a purely ""natural"" way of living by fetishizing and romanticizing natives. Princess Mononoke also doesn't rely on cartoonishly evil villains (which is pretty ironic in this case) as it showcases how the oppressors of nature and natives are often dealing with opressors and threats of their own.

At the end of the day, humans are a part of nature, making our industrial societies and destruction of forests and such a completely natural process. That's why the whole idea of ""nature fighting back"" is ridiculous. You can't claim to truly love nature if you hate what humanity is doing.

"The problem is the main humans that show up in these stories represent the absolute worst aspects of humanity (aka greed and power). The only exceptions to that are people like Jake, Spider, Norm, Max, Trudy, and Grace (and I guess Dr. Garvin in the latest film). Obviously they're making an effort to try and make Quaritch more sympathetic through Spider going forward but people really still need to remind themselves that Quaritch is a man who A) sent thousands of his people to their deaths needlessly in the first film because Jake hurt his feefees and he wanted to send a message to the Na'vi and B) was putting a bunch of innocent reef clan villages to the torch in the latest film just to extract Jake's whereabouts from them. The man is still to put it plainly a war-mongering pos. The only reason he was on Pandora in the first place was for the thrill of looking for more enemies to fight. Quaritch is a classic case of one of those soldiers who never learned how to leave war behind, he just has to go looking for it elsewhere and that in turn has turned him into a sociopath.

As far as Jake goes I'd question what loyalty he really owes to humanity (for people that insist that he's a traitor to his own race). He doesn't want humanity destroyed or to go into extinction or anything like that. He wants them off of Pandora A) to keep his family safe and B) because he knows most of the RDA folks are incapable of playing nice with the natives and are only going to destroy Pandora's natural biosphere as long as they're on the planet due to their greed. You saw in the extended edition of the first film what Jake's life was like back on Earth. He had nothing. He was a paraplegic war veteran living in a shitty apartment on a dying planet where the system completely abandoned him after he was deemed ""no longer useful"" (aka when he was paralyzed from the waist down). Even the circumstances behind how he first ended up on Pandora (going in his brother's place due to Tommy being murdered for the paper in his wallet and the RDA seeing an opportunity with him) were pretty shitty. Even Quaritch's ""you're going to get your legs back"" promise was a completely empty promise compared to what Neytiri gave him (which was love, something that arguably Jake had never experienced before back on Earth). That's honestly what makes the story so powerful. That two people from different worlds who could not be more different from each other fall that madly in love and create this beautiful family out of it.",5,k15euz4,Avatar,t3_16lvmjj,t3_16lvmjj,1695056665.0

They are now leading the colonization efforts to again save humanity. The resources they gather directly benefit that effort. Unubtainium helps power their ships and Amrita would be immensely invaluable in interstellar travel. 

Furthermore, while their actions can be extreme they are never genocidal as some like to believe. Hell in the first film it’s implied the RDA have been patient with the Navi for a time at least.

"Because there’s only one race, the human race! In the name of the God Emperor of Mankind I… Wait wrong franchise.

Seriously, honest answer even though I may get downvoted? First, they have cooler tech and ships. But, here’s the thing, I’m no pro-RDA, I am pro-Humanity. It has to do with the fact that if we found ourselves in that situation IRL, I wouldn’t blame anyone for conquering Pandora if it meant that humanity (us) gets a chance to survive. I have both, Native American and Spaniard ancestry (can trace my lineage back to a conquistador and even farther back) so it kinda hits close to home and I’ve actually thought about it. In the end I realized that if it wasn’t the Spaniards, someone else would’ve conquered America; the Chinese, the Ottomans, one of the stronger factions with better technology, weapons, tactics… Plus, it was that conquest that allowed the Americas to catch up to the rest of the world technologically, which led to us, here. With intercontinental travel, better architecture, better metalworking, etc. 

I guess I’m applying the same logic to Avatar. Both sides are fighting for their survival, and only the strongest survive. I’m siding with the one who I believe doesn’t just have the most realistic chance of winning, but also deserves it. One can argue the Humans have learned from their mistakes and will make the most of this second chance. Probably why they haven’t resorted to viral or chemical warfare or a scorched earth policy. Yet. If they won, the Na’vi are unlikely to learn, or change anything after this, not even to ensure their own continual survival. They won’t build defensive structures, improve their technology, etc. They’ll go back to their primitive ways. 

I’ll leave this fan-made excerpt that pretty much explains what I’m trying to say: 

*“Spare us your pity, alien. You gush about your connection with nature, your primal wisdom, but what has it brought you?*

*Where are your marvels of engineering? Your voyages of discovery? Your great insight into the nature of the universe? Even at our basest, when we dressed as you do, dwelt as you do, hunted as you do, lived as you do, we did more than merely survive. We built wonders. We made great journeys. We forged epics. You have not.*

*You speak so proudly of the plugs dangling from your skulls, little realizing that they are but strings and you puppets. What little you have accomplished you attribute to the wisdom of your goddess, who is nothing but the voices of your dead echoing for all eternity. She moors you to the past, serving as a leash that keeps you as little better than apes, sad parodies of civilization that lack that special spark to become something more.*

*We have come to your world in search of resources. Whether your actions drive us back or we take what we want and move on, the outcome is the same. We will depart from your wretched planet, leaving you behind. And in a thousand years, you will not have changed from this contact with another world. You will remain in your trees, hunting your prey, communing with your goddess, until your sun burns out and your world dies.*

*And above your tomb, the stars will belong to us.""*",5,k15gak5,Avatar,t3_16lvmjj,t3_16lvmjj,1695057174.0

Despite knowing better, willing to admit the negative effects the RDA has on humanity as well as the immorality of their actions on Pandora against the Na’vi that shares a lot of the same qualities with us. My monkey brain goes, it’s us or them. It’s like a self-critical indulgence.

I mean, we’re destructive colonial space invaders searching for solutions toward global issues we’ve brought upon ourselves with our collective lack of wisdom thru exploitative and violent means. But realistically, if I had to support prolonging Earth’s existence at the expense of others in a war far away from it’s metaphorical shores.. which is the issue, I see myself as being complacent with the status quo like anyone.

No matter how much you are against the RDA or disagree with them. It just feels wrong supporting those that kill your own kind; I think it’s more grounded to think that you can’t help feeling otherwise no matter whatever reasons. I believe no matter how much you empathise or sympathise, you can’t actually be a methane breathing 8ft blue alien in touch with a planetary central nervous system. 

If I find myself in that story, I would align myself with that which is familiar.

It's uncanny valley in a way, everything about the Na'vi is too perfect, while the humans are too evil. It makes my brain think that there's far more to the story that's missing, and when I fill in the gaps of why the humans might be taking the actions they do, it's far more compelling. 

Is Quaritch just a generic military bad guy? Or is he a veteran who's been hardened and worn down by years of insurgent warfare, as witnessed by his warnings to the new men and damage to vehicles, who finally has a chance to strike back at where he thinks the Na'vi attacks that keep killing his men are coming from? 

How about Parker? Just a greedy business guy, or a guy who is torn by trying to follow orders from above with as minimal damage as possible, knowing that if he doesn't someone else will replace him? Or if he fails Humanity's chance to reach the stars might collapse and humanity will burn itself out? 

Which is a more interesting interpretation? 

Jake is running around having beautiful adventures as a Na'vi, yet none of the dangers of tribal life seems to be a thing. He's not weighing the benefits of say modern medicine that humans have against the Freedom of the Na'vi. He's not had to watch as one of his fellow Ikran tamers falls to their death because they made a mistake, or one of the hunters makes a mistake and gets trampled. He's not seeing a Na'vi woman die in childbirth or having to comment about preparing for the lean season when the herds will leave and they will have to rely on stored food, he's not having to train to fight a rival tribe that might try and poach their herd.

"Other then being human

In the lore Earth is dying from overpopulation and environmental failure

Which is why the RDA is on Pandora, to mine resources so Earth can survive

When first arriving, the Humans did try to be peaceful, spending untold billions to try and study Na'vi, learn about them and speak their language, early attempts were successful, but due to Human activity, the Na'vi quickly became hostile due to their religion and the planet god Ewa, who deemed humans as a virus needing to be removed

And since every tree and plant is sacred in Na'vi eyes, humans clearing an area pisses the Na'vi off like a religious zealot or fundamentalist on Earth

After being kicked off planet, the humans return in force, which is understandable, and are now playing for survival, as Pandora is the new Earth, to either be Terraformed or be inhabited by humans brought from earth

Plus the way Na'vi are presented as ""perfect"" annoys me, they are too ideal and the Ewa idea is downright horrifying, its like a supercomputer controlling the navi like ants but nobody realizes it

Plus the Na'vi idealism reminds me how history is being revised, like how Native Americans are presented as being peaceful, while they fought and killed each other long before Europeans arrived (not trying to start a war, just stating a fact that people chose to ignore)

For example, let's take the phone you and I have. Its battery consists of materials that were mined in the mines of Africa. These mines utilize people who work in unacceptable conditions, in some cases comparable to outright slavery. Despite that, we all gladly pay these corporations for the phones or other things that we want to have and happily utilize for our own needs without knowledge of the origin of things we buy. Same here with Avatar movies. RDA is a company that exploits local population and area to satisfy customers such as you and me, although in the movie, it is stated that RDA does that to save humanity/planet. In the eyes of many my explanation of hypocrisy that I see and overall my position in this situation is not the best. We humans are very different and yet common people.

That’s clearly not true, as they kill animals and pick fruits and roots themselves. They just know how to co-exist with nature.

“The humans destroyed hometree as Jake himself said ‘they will never move’.”
We know for a fact that they were going to destroy the tree regardless. It was just a question of whether or not they could relocate the Na’vi there or not. Flip it around…what if an alien species with superior technology came along to earth and said “we need the resources on your planet. If you let us move you elsewhere while we plunder it, we promise nobody will be hurt,” what would you do? You would fight for your home of course.

"I'd disagree. For all intents and purposes, the RDA is the representation of human culture, intent and power on Pandora. From the Na'vi perspective the RDA and humanity are interchangeable because on Pandora, they are. 

Trudy, Jake etc are/were humans in the physical sense but reject humanity to fight for the Na'vi. They belong to the Na'vi, and that is recognised by both themselves and the Na'vi even though it can be difficult for both (i.e. Neytiri and Ronals tension with Norm and Max when treating Kiri). 

All of them know there's no going back, not only physically but socially and psychologically. Trudy's line about martyrdom is really deep and touching in this respect. It's not just the perceived hopelessness of the fight she's referring to, but a recognition that shes crossed a psychological boundary. She will die in Omatikaya colours, having given her last breath fighting the forces of humanity for the Na'vi. 

On that note it's be interesting to see if there was some ritual or ceremony to recognise or honour the humans who fight for the Omatikaya, and those who died doing so. In the deleted scenes we see Trudy teach a class, showing the Omatikaya how to attack and destroy human aircraft.

"The entire point of the story is that humans deserve to live but they also need to learn how to share a planet like Pandora with other species since they weren't there first. The RDA big wigs are incapable of doing that. They think of Pandora's natural resources as rightfully theirs for the taking (whether it's amrita, unobtanium, or another rare substance that they're using to make a profit in the next film) and if any natives happen to get in their way they kill them without hesitation and make them their enemy because ""they're primitives and we have the superior weapons and technology so who cares if they decide to fight back."" That pattern needs to change at some point in order for Jake and the Na'vi to warm up to the idea of sharing Pandora with humanity.

In a way it's kind of similar to the story of Christopher Columbus discovering America for the first time (and all the Native Americans that were subsequently slaughtered mercilessly by people looking to colonize their land because of that). Most of the humans that have shown up in these stories (as Jake said in the first film) believe that they can take whatever they want. And that's ultimately the biggest issue and why Jake doesn't want them on Pandora. Selfridge was the biggest example of that in the first film (Quaritch is a soldier whose only purpose on Pandora is to fight and kill, he doesn't care as much about resources and RDA interests).

"What need do the Na'vi have for human technology and resources? They've lived on the planet for thousands of years without it (as Jake said in the first film in his log ""there's nothing we have that they want""). Forcing that on them as a contingency for their continued survival (evolve or die) is straight up fascism and an action that Hitler would've been proud of (the entire reason he started WWII in the first place was because he wanted to displace citizens of every other country in Europe to acquire ""living space"" for the German people). The entire idea of coexisting with another race is learning to respect them for who they are and giving them their space, not by oppressing them. The RDA has no clue how to do that. They're all about destroying everything simply to see what shiny objects they can dig up and squeeze a profit out of (and in the case of the latest film they've resorted to murdering sentient beings simply to obtain the anti-aging goo that exists in their brains and make a profit off of it). The entire reason why war-mongering sociopaths like Quaritch are even on Pandora to begin with is because they enjoy killing no matter who it is and they get the job done. Essentially humanity came to Pandora expecting war and resistance and for the foreseeable future any humans that continue to flock to the planet like flies to shit are going to continue to approach it with that mindset.

"Jake literally says in the first film as he's pleading to Eywa for help that humans ""killed their mother"" (meaning that they destroyed Earth) so I think he's aware that the planet is dying to some degree. Maybe not to the extent that it's time for everyone to leave though since A2 takes place many years after the first film and obviously he's been living on Pandora for quite some time at this point and is relatively detached from his old life.

I think Jake's empathy for humanity is clouded by the fact that most of the human factions currently on Pandora want him dead (in Ardmore's case because he's a threat to them and a nuisance to their supply lines and in Quaritch's case because of a personal vendetta). Not to mention they're willing to kill his wife and children just to send a message. I think Jake is capable of having empathy for humans (case in point his good relationships with Norm, Max, and the other humans who were allowed to stay on Pandora and also his willingness to take Spider in). The problem is the absolute worst representatives of humanity (Quaritch, Selfridge, Scoresby, General Ardmore) keep showing up on Pandora with the intent of taking everything for themselves and trampling anyone who gets in their way and obviously Jake is not having that.

"> who don’t know how to have civilized discussions from all sides of the political spectrum

One side complains that even the *inclusion* of LGBTQ+, minority, or female characters is bad while the other is supportive of their inclusion. The motivated harassment campaigns a specific segment of the ""Star Wars Fandom"" have lead against Kelly Marie Tran and Moses Ingram, to name two of at least a dozen actors and actresses, are beyond ""both sides"". They are clearly and openly racist. There is a pattern among a  very vocal chunk of the Star Wars fandom that is openly, and seemingly proudly, bigoted. Many of these same individuals make similar claims about the MCU and lead similarly bigoted harassment campaigns there.


There is no mincing words on that. There is no ""both sides"" to that. The Star Wars ""Fandom"" has a problem with racists and sexists, as does the internet ""at large"", and it has been increasing for over a decade.

GamerGate was the mainstream ""start"" of this and was *directly* started as a misogynistic hate campaign. A good number of those who participated in it are also participating in the ""Star Wars Discourse"". Video Games, Comic Books, and pretty much all ""nerd"" media has seen this kind of bigotry grow.

GamerGate and its offshoots though were also ""conceived"" in Internet Space where the line between trolling and actual bigotry is thin. That is by design as it protects the bigotry. The video series ""[Why Are You So angry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y8XgGhXkTQ&list=PLJA_jUddXvY62dhVThbeegLPpvQlR4CjF)"" examines this in great detail while also documenting the early history of GamerGate and how it has gone on to influence internet fandom space.",10,k16fp50,Avatar,t3_16lvmjj,t1_k1691nj,1695069691.0

Only Grace's group of scientists attempted this (and there's a reason why those people were the only humans allowed to stay on Pandora). And for awhile it was working (see the Adapt or Die comics). But Selfridge constantly got involved and micromanaged the whole thing (because he never supported Grace's efforts to bridge the gap between the Na'vi and humans to begin with) and eventually Neytiri's sister was killed due to the clear-cutting and Grace's school was subsequently shut down (a decision the RDA made). As we pretty clearly see in the first film Selfridge very much prefers Quaritch's methods (which are to kill all primitives that cross them) to Grace's methods. He didn't account for Quaritch recklessly sending thousands of his workers to their deaths the way he did when he rigged the shuttle as a bomber but he still preferred displacing the Na'vi from their homes by force rather than negotiating with them. That's ultimately on the RDA, not the Na'vi. The Na'vi are only guilty of trying to defend their homes because humanity constantly keeps infringing on their territory (Hometree was literally the home of the Omatikaya for crying out loud and the RDA destroyed it because it was an unobtanium hotspot).",5,k1ae8ei,Avatar,t3_16lvmjj,t1_k18qecf,1695139240.0

The human culture was never friendly or willing to compromise with the Na'vi.

">Ideally coexistence would be the answer, but unfortunately it is not an option.

The RDA is entirely the reason why coexistence is not possible right now. Why do you think people like Quaritch are on the planet in the first place? To kill and destroy everything in their path. People like Grace were on the planet specifically to negotiate with them and bridge that gap (and for awhile she was actually doing well in that regard as the Adapt or Die comics point out) but look at how much her efforts were constantly undermined due to Selfridge being impatient and greedy. The Na'vi are hostile to humans on the planet because they pushed them to that point and Quaritch ultimately took things to an inexcusable level when he tried to drop a nuclear warhead on their most sacred place of worship (which wasn't an act that would've benefited humanity in any way, he was just butthurt over Jake's betrayal and wanted to send a message). To the Na'vi humans are alien invaders who are on the planet specifically to subjugate and enslave them (and humanity has done nothing to disprove that view for the most part aside from a few exceptions). Can you really blame them for being hostile under those circumstances? The only thing they're guilty of is killing humans to simply defend their homes (since humans were constantly infringing on their territory). Humanity doesn't have any ""right"" to Pandora other than ""we have the bigger toys and can make things go boom in the night so move or we'll kill you and families without hesitation.""

Their industrialism raped their own world of resources and has left it dying. They would not even be in the situation of needing to invade Pandora if that were not true.

>You call it a thought-terminating cliche but what are your answer to his rhetorical question? 

Again, it's *systemic* not individual. Looking at these problems from the angle of ""Well, you participate too, so clearly you can't have a say"" ignores that actual change is not going to come from ""not participating"" but actively tearing down the systems of exploitation that exist. 

Yes, people use cell phones that's just the way things are. Yes, such technology is produced from horrific abuse.  Now move on, stop shaming people for using them, and work to end the exploitation that produces them. Instead of using energy to shame people and use that energy to organize workers. Yes, refusing to purchase a cell phone *is* a form of protest, but it is one that ultimately has less impact than organizing with a group that seeks to address such issues would have. 



Such questions are ""thought terminating"" because all they do is present any attempt at change as ""Well, everything is bad actually"" instead of putting the onus on the system that has allowed such problems to develop. It's apathetic, if not outright detrimental, to finger wag at individuals in such a manner when the abuses are so clearly systemic or carried out by those who hold power. 

Should abusive manufacturing practices end? Absolutely, but that will only be accomplished by condemning those who perpetuate/profit from it and by dismantling the systems that benefit them. Consumer ""choice"" or ""voting with your wallet"" is a false choice that *can* have an impact but will never actually end it.

There was no negotiation whatsoever on the part of the humans in TWOW (the humans have been completely uninterested in negotiating with the Na'vi since Grace was killed and Jake defected).

"The science missions are a direct reference to how colonialism works in irl. When Europeans invaded Australia we brought scientists and clergy with us, but it was to learn more about the environment to find more ways to exploit it, not for any noble purpose (even if some of the individuals involved were, like Grace Augustine, signing on to a horrific mission in order to try and do something better) while the clergy were there to keep the indigineous quiet and out of the way, not negotiate and certainly not to help Europeans assimilate (quite the opposite). 

Same on Pandora. Humans needed to study the world to find out how to exploit unobtainium, amrita etc. as well as the avatars themselves, the programme for which wasn't solely or even primarily abt diplomacy. The school is interesting as it serves to teach the Na'vi English and about human culture, not the other way around, just like irl mission schools did in colonised countries.

The only peace humans really wanted was for the Na'vi to not fight back and let the humans get on with exploiting their home without any hassle.

It's not a negotiation or peace if you refuse to accept a negative answer. When the Na'vi said no, the humans tried to take what they wanted anyway.

Na'vi beliefs aren't strictly religious in the theistic sense as they have a direct and tangible neurological connection to their planetary entity. It is not a belief, as Grace herself points out, it's hard biology. They exist within a colonial, siphonophore like entity and will respond accordingly if the larger organism is harmed... an immune response.

"“Harming anything is heresy and Ewa tells them to fight”
That’s clearly not true, as they kill animals and pick fruits and roots themselves. They just know how to co-exist with nature. That’s pretty much what Ewa is - their version of Mother Nature, which they can directly connect to. Humans were never going to be able to co-exist in the same way - and the RDA had no desire to.

“The humans destroyed hometree as Jake himself said ‘they will never move’.”
We know for a fact that they were going to destroy the tree regardless. It was just a question of whether or not they could relocate the Na’vi there or not. Flip it around…what if an alien species with superior technology came along to earth and said “we need the resources on your planet. If you let us move you elsewhere while we plunder it, we promise nobody will be hurt,” what would you do? You would fight for your home of course. Who would want some invaders coming along and plundering your home, your sacred places?

Anyone with even the slightest bit of empathy can see what the RDA is doing is terrible.

In Frontiers of Pandora, the RDA do exactly this.

&#x200B;

> With Education brings opportunity, just think what a Na'vi philosopher or scientist can discover with a unique mindset 

Would it be meaningful to them? Your applying the values not only of a different culture, but a different species. It's safe to say, as Jake notes in the first movie, there's nothing humans have that the Na'vi want. 

&#x200B;

> Grace is teaching them earth customs and language to communicate with Na'vi 

Again this is a colonialist mindset, not that of one interested in co-existence. Had the desire been peaceful co-existence then then the newcomers would started by learning Na'vi language, etiquette, custom and way of life and seek to assimilate - essentially undertaking the journey Jake takes. Mo'at says she has tried this before but the humans refuse to learn (""It's hard to fill a cup which is already full"").

&#x200B;

> Because they never truly did a cultural exchange no side knew the others intentions or demands, 

The Humans know exactly what the Na'vi position is, they just don't care.

 

>It's not just the RDA, the Na'vi were  very close minded and because of primitive communication, higher  negotiations devolve into heated exchanges fueled through emotion

This is essentially the same arguement used to justify subjugation of other cultures for centuries - ""They're too primitive to understand our important work"" - at that point you're already heading toward genocide, the rest is just formalities.

"Its ok, i do that sometimes

Ewa sees the humans as an infection, it reacts as such and summons creatures to attack them, they say this in 2, in the first Jake has to beg for Ewa to get involved

What i mean is from a religious standpoint the Na'vi are borderline extremist in their views, Neytiri gets made at Jake for killing an animal, when an RDA bulldozer destroys a tree it will just piss navi off even more

The humans have a good reason for their presence (saving humanity), they spent untold billions and billions on attempts to communicate and coexist, they even made a school and brought an army of scientists with them

Humans did attempt peace, but due to requirements are forced to be the bad guys

Hometree was always going to be destroyed, it sat on a big Unobtanium deposit, it would be torn down and strip mined like the site near Hell's Gate. Jakes mission was to find a way to make them MOVE, he only told the Na'vi this when the miltiary was on its way (he waited and was busy dating Neytiri

Without our Ancestors being pricks, the world as we know it would be so different it would be unimaginable

The world economy at one point depended on the African Slave trade for sugar, thats why the Carribean is developed, Brazil and Chile due to cape horn, Austrailia due to the loss of the 13 Colonies, Canada due to the british saying holy fuck Canada is huge (which people still do not realize how fucking huge Canada is)

Without expansion, Europe would be a bubble of civilization with a messed up Aisa (Japan wouldn't open, China remains closed), Unpopulated Indochina and Austrailia, Americas with nothing but tribal wars, and Africa essentially being Africa but way more primitive with internal wars and stuff

For all the horrible shit our Ancestors did, we have a pretty good world today

I think what your describing in Sydney is urban decay, liberal politicians like to be more friendly with homeless and drug issues, nearly every major city has this problem, but its probably local leadership being shitty

"I think somewhere in the lore implied that the Na'vi did start using higher technology (steel such), but they gave it up at some point

My issue with Ewa is as a sentient planet it can order things and people around like a god.

Humans have spent thousands of years trying to be the dominant force on the planet (not be hunted by animals for example), plus with advances in food and technology, living off the land like the Na'vi would be insanely difficult, and humans travelling to another Star system will not give up their stuff easily

Theres a series called one second after about an EMP attack taking out the US and Europe, by 5 years later when the rebuilt US government does a census the population dropped from 320 million to 30. most of this was due to lack of food, cities became worthless, small towns could not deal with the influx, and without technology crops became unharvestable as they were too big to harvest and took longer (one or two a year compared to 4 or 5 harvests a year)

The planet of pandora is the equivelent to the entire surface area of Europe, asia, and africa, even with oceans there is alot of space to live on.

Even then, the Na’vi don’t respond like mindless drones, they choose to respond (and why wouldn’t they, their world is literally asking for their help).

It is quite possible that humanity could set up in a completely out-of-the-way spot on Pandora and keep to themselves and not disturb the rest of the world, and therefore co-exist in that way. However, the RDA has shown absolutely no signs of wanting to do that. They want the resources there, plain and simple, and they don’t give a damn about the ecosystem or the people whose planet they are trying to rape for resources the same way they did their own (which is what led to their planet dying in the first place).",1,kbxy6o8,Avatar,t3_16lvmjj,t1_kbxueit,1701690634.0

But Who knows.. I really would love to know, but to me it really seemed that parts of the jungle, when the actor was real, were real for these purposes, to have it kinda grounded even more.

but of course, I'm just speculating. the jungle looks impressive, so..

and with how they improved their performance capture in Planet of the Apes, I am keen to believe they had also real parts of the jungle (only the immediate surrounding, ofc) when the actor is there too, so it adds to the realism, and they blend in the Na'Vi instead of the actor into CG stuff.

But at this point with how insanely good it looks, who knows?! But the first pic seems so real, that immediate area around the real actor. While the second and third looks more like all of it is digital behind him. And in the trailer we've already seen some fakery to achieve ""reality"", in the closeup shot of hand tying something on the water, those were real hands painted blue. So I would bet they are mixing it like this. On top of that add how WETA improved their performance capture in Planet of the Apes 2 and were able to almost seamlessly blend the CG characters in 2 and 3 in a real environment. So! My guess would be it's a mix of everything. Parts of the real set with set extended jungle, with real actor interacting with real studio jungle (or is it a real one? :D) while the actor is performing beside the actor, and then the CG character is blended into a real enviroment. 

And it jumps from scene to scene. second and third pic seem like pure blue/green screen work. So imo, it'll be jumping around, depending on the scenes.

"Why wouldn't we? It's abundantly clear that the Navi have feelings. They suffer just as we do. If preventing suffering is enough of a justification to get us to care about our own animals, why shouldn't it be for the Navi?

It's pretty heartless to be asking for a justification as to why you can't just genocide a species that doesn't just match us in intelligence, but which acts like us, has the same emotions we do, and who we can even communicate with. It would be exactly like killing another human. Do they have any less right to live than you just because they're blue and you're not?

The Navi are just fiction, but there may come a time in the future where we have to consider this for real with an actual alien species. Its overwhelmingly likely that they won't look anything like us, but I still don't think that's justification at all to treat them worse than we'd treat a fellow human. Some humans seem to have this horrible idea that just because something else doesn't look like them, it's somehow less deserving of existing.

1 why does it matter they have feelings?

2 why does their suffering matter?

3 earth animals belong to us and provide many benefits to human civilisation.

4 genocide is the destruction of a people nation or ethnicity. Only humans are people. Nation only applies to humans, we don't say a pack of orcas are a nation. Ethnicity also only applies to humans. 
The aliens are organised into tribes which is different to what a person, nation, or ethnicity is.

"Holy shit. Wow. I talked about this kind of mentality in previous replies, but it's another thing to see it exhibited so clearly here. I don't think we can ever come to a consensus through appeals to morality here because my whole argument relies on at least a shred of moral decency. Yes, morality isn't intrinsic to the universe, its something we made up, but if we treat it so urgently when talking about other humans, why shouldn't that extend to animals? Aliens? Alien animals?

I don't know if you're trolling, but if you're not, what you said here is genuinely concerning. That path you've chosen to go down is the exact same mentality that led to, and still leads to, racism and xenophobia. From the moment you convince yourself that the ""other"" is not deserving of the same rights as you are, just because they are different, you're opening yourself up to throwing anything in that ""other"" category that you personally deem doesn't deserve to live peacefully.

There's a limit to this, as with anything. Of course there's some suffering we just can't avoid unless we cease existing completely. We need meat to survive, and we need space to live. That doesn't mean we should be careless and destroy everything just because we can. We strive to take only what we need, and we live because there's always an inherent selfishness in existing. Every living being looks out for its own first and foremost.

Now, imagine yourself as the victim of an alien invasion. What would you, personally think is reasonable for the technologically superior invading aliens to do? Following your logic, it's perfectly ok for them to step all over us, destroy the planet to dig up whatever they need and kill anyone who tries to stop them. This is precisely what every empire in human history has used as an excuse to kill, pillage, conquer and destroy. I really hope that line of yours about how ""Rights are given and earned, history dictates this."" doesn't mean what I think it means.",3,k16cx4h,Avatar,t3_16jq745,t1_k15u101,1695068697.0

The scene where Ardmore is walking with him and explaining the situation is one of my favorite scenes in the movie.

It depends where he’ll go in Avatar 3, will he meet Varang ? Probably learn with her some things, as a Na’vi, he will obviously need to connect with Eywa and BTW Eywa didn’t kill all his team and him, She could’ve sent animals towards them but no maybe there’s a plan..

He is pretty much a direct foil to Jake (and more indirectly, to Spider and Kiri) but 'made wrong,' so to speak.

This means that essentially, he is the same person as the original, and had he survived his final battle in the first film, he would have displayed the same redeeming qualities as his clone because they share the exact same personality. The reason why the clone doesn't remember the colonel's final moments is because the memories were downloaded before the final battle, so of course the clone is not going to remember the moments after the memories were extracted.

"Because in the context of the movies, it *is* that serious.

It's like saying the Conquistadors were justified because they ""gave"" the natives the ""opportunity"" to submit freely to their control. 

But because the Na'Vi aren't human, people view them as less important. Humanities future, if we have one, lies with the stars. 

If another intelligent race were to come to our world, and told us they're going to enslave us and strip mine our planet, everyone would feel that would be wrong and evil. 

But if *we* do it, it's justified, because we are most important, right? Avatar might just be a fantasy story, but the way people respond to stories tells you a lot about them. It doesn't matter if it's real or fantasy, a genocide is a genocide, it shouldn't matter whether it's a historical reality or a hypothetical. Arguing that one group is justified in their genocide of another, equally intelligent group.. yeah. I'd argue that's serious. 

Whether people are just trying to be edgy, I don't know and don't care. Genocide is wrong, period. Just because we have an innate drive to live, doesn't mean we are justified. 

If two people are trapped on an island and only one can live, who gets to live? Both people want to live, and it's **understandable** that someone in that situation would kill another to save themselves. 

It's **understandable**. Having a motive, and understanding that motive, doesn't mean it is justified. Which of the two gets to live? They're equally innocent, equally want to live. Who's life is more valuable? Yeah, your own life is understandably going to be more valuable to you than a strangers. In that situation, would I try to save myself? Probably. Just as most people would. 

That doesn't make it *justified*. The humans are 100%, entirely, clearly and **objectively** the bad guys. Just because they ruined **their** planet, that does **not** entitle them to another's. If I don't pay my mortgage and lose my house, can I come and murder you and take your house? That would be okay, right? I don't want to be homeless, and you have a home, but you don't have room for me too... but I don't want to be homeless, and you have a home, so I'm *justified* in murdering you because you won't share your house, right?",3,k32v00d,Avatar,t3_16x0yo8,t1_k31mks9,1696208323.0

There is definitely a strong colonial analogy too, I wouldn't doubt it for a moment, as it's neither subtle nor hidden. But I think to see it solely as a historical analogy to the colonisation of the new world is to miss some the contemporary stresses on modern society it reflects as well. Some are obvious like disconnection from nature, environmental crimes and so on, but there are also themes like hubris, celebration of ignorance (Jake seeking to learn while Selfridge refuses to accept there are things he doesn't know), the ""move fast and break things"" culture, the disconnect between knowledge and information, dehumanisation, depersonalisation and alienation caused by technological advance etc.",3,k357w8g,Avatar,t3_16x0yo8,t1_k355ubb,1696257136.0

All of that makes Jake believable as a character. People who want him to be perfect are missing the point.",182,jv47btq,Avatar,t3_15k6e6u,t3_15k6e6u,1691379290.0

"I think on the Neytiri and Spider front it stems from the fact that the audience can see Spiders actions while he's detained. We know he fought the mind probe and we know he deeply cares about the Sullys and the people. 

But Neytiri's experience with humans has almost always been ""They lie"" and therefore, they can not be trusted. Humans set a school, act like they want to help. Then her sister and others are killed. Even with Jake. She fell in love just to find that he lied. 

Humans just sort of have a heavy track record of taking from Pandora as well. And it rolls into way of water as well. And a big thing with Spider and her distaste is heavy in the fact that because he knows so much, when he's captured, she has to leave her home and people because Spider knows too much. What happens the next time he is captured? What's it going to cost her this time? Spider being captured meant she had to leave her clan and abandon her promise to her father, at the beginning, his captive status meant that Loak went to save him and guess what? Neteyam, her first, is killed. And with Quaritch? Spider is Neytiri's ticket to not losing yet another child. 

I find it irksome that people think that because Neytiri fell for Jake it means she must like humans. Its kind of a dumb argument.  She fell for Jake through teaching him to be one of the people. Up til she knew he was a liar, she thought he was different. But no, he was just another human, a liar. 

And how does he win her back? By proving that he had learned, that he was willing to adapt to their culture and rolling up on the biggest baddest banshee in the sky. Yeah they have that tender moment where she saves human Jake...but she forgot for a few moments beforehand that human Jake was a thing. 

As for Jake and Lo'ak, we'll, he sees himself in Lo'ak.  We're harshest on ourselves. And I do think a big frustration for Jake is that he wants to protect his kids so desperately yet Lo'ak keeps dragging others into dangerous situations  (from Jake's pov). He knows what being a hothead can cost, that it can get people killed. It's a message Lo'ak isn't getting. 

I also think it's a problem people would have meeting their teen selves. Teen me and her angst and thickheadedness would drive me nuts. And now I have to keep teen me alive? Oof.",30,jv4io0f,Avatar,t3_15k6e6u,t3_15k6e6u,1691386317.0
"Nah I feel the same way.  Neytiri’s dislike of humans stems from a lot of trauma.  Having a couple human friends doesn’t just magically fix that.  And Loak I honestly can’t stand.  There are a lot of simps for him on reddit, but I just think he’s the worst.  I mean yeah he’s a kid blah blah blah, but he doesn’t listen EVER.  He doesn’t grow in that respect.  Everything bad in the movie just about happens because of something he’s done - e.g., forsaking his spotter duty during the raid, visiting the shack that was forbidden, running off to warn Payakan without consulting anyone, staying aboard the ship to find Spider on his own. He’s like Thick44 from Neebs Gaming (Rest in Peace, good sir); his poor decisions constantly jeopardize those around him (this behavior is even coined as “getting thick’d” in the urban dictionary).  He does one redeemable thing the whole movie, saving his father.  Otherwise, he is perpetually leading others to dire straits, and it gets his brother killed.  Nateyam’s death isn’t his fault, but Loak’s decisions are accessories to event.  Just like if I spill milk, it’s not my fault as there was no intention behind the act - an accident, but my involvement was still integral to the act transpiring.",25,jv423na,Avatar,t3_15k6e6u,t3_15k6e6u,1691376534.0

Also, Jake was in the situation of war. He will have to be protective. In that case anyone who messes up will get harsh speech. And Jake knew Loak too well, that's why he treated Loak that way.

An explanation isn't an excuse.

With Jake - his military background combined with the situation they're in is why he treats the kids that way.  But it's clearly causing problems, and hopefully he realizes this and adjusts his parenting style after the events of TWOW.

Neytiri's attitude toward Spider is just pure bigotry. Yes, she was hurt by humans.  No, that does not excuse any of her behavior toward him.  Jake actually helped the RDA destroy Hometree and kill her father, and she forgave him in like two days.  Spider had nothing to do with any of that, and he's shown nothing but love and loyalty to her family and her people.  In TWOW he did plenty to prove his loyalty to the Na'vi, and I really hope she sees that.

It's really unsettling to see how many people think there's nothing wrong with her behavior.

"I can give you the spotter thing but the rest is way exaggerated. There was no way Lo'ak or any one could've known about Recoms being something that even existed not to mention that they would just happen to be there in the exact same spot in the forest the kids went to. As for as they know  humans cannot really come there because of the immune response so they are just risking meeting some animals or such. And it's not like Lo'ak did it alone or force the others - they all wanted it - and neither thought it particularly dangerous. They got just super unlucky.

The other two cases were actually heroic. The kids saved Payakan's life by removing that beacon and they did it in the last moment so waiting to get adults on board would've left him dead. And you know there would've been a big discussion if Payakan was worthy and that it can wait.

Same with Spider - he crashed that ship and was being escorted to boat back to Bridgehead. Without Quaritch (dead or losing position due to the whole operation failing) there would be nothing to stop people there from treating him as a terrorist for doing that. They were willing to torture this kid to death before he did anything - what would they do to him after he actually fought against them?

"Heroism and poor decision making aren’t mutually exclusive.  Leaving to save Payakan was indeed heroic, but it was also an extremely poor choice.  It was a decision that led to being pursued and setting up the opportunity for his family to be captured. Intentional? No.  But still yet another outcome that has put his family in danger as a result of HIS poor decisions.  

As for the scene earlier at the shack, no he couldn’t have known about the recoms, BUT he explicitly comments on the size of the footprints they found and how they seemingly belong to avatars.  And instead of heading back after fighting something off-putting at a place he wasn’t supposed to be in the first place, he instead chooses to satisfy curiosity instead at the expense of those around him.  

Lastly, again while running off to save Spider was noble, it doesn’t mean it was the “right” choice.  We have no way of knowing whether a more fortuitous circumstance may have presented itself later for them to retake Spider from the recoms.  It had been months already, and Spider was still alive.  There’s no reason to think he was in any immediate peril.  Loak made an impulse decision to stay aboard and try and retrieve Spider without thinking about if there might be a smarter way to handle the situation.  They save Spider, and Netetam pays the price for it.  We see this impulsive decision making again and again. The bullies ask him to fish outside the reef, we even hear Loak exclaim that he knows he’s not allowed, and he gets taunted into it anyway.  If Payakan hadn’t luckily shown up, then the boy was about to become shark food.  The scene where Neteyam has browbeat the bullies, Loak decides to go back and start a fight because again he impulsively responds to a taunt.  And both him and his brother get scuffed up (even if they beat the others up worse).  Loak makes impulsive decision after impulsive decision and the people around him pay for it.

And what’s worse?  He then claims to be an outcast, because he’s constantly getting in trouble.  His “outcast” is literally self-imposed!  It’s not like people around him actively ostracize him.  We see over and over he’s actually often surrounded by a social group of peers who listen, albeit not always understanding or believing him.  So it’s not like he’s treated like a pariah.  He feels outcast, because he’s berated for his poor decisions!  Lol and instead of trying to do better, he doubles down on it again and again.  It makes the whole “outcast” thing a circular feedback loop of his own design! 
And

And you know… it might have been tolerable IF Loak had shown any development with this behavior or awareness of his actions, but he doesn’t!  He makes the same kind of decisions all the way up until the end.  The director even calls the viewer’s attention purposefully to Loak’s hands stained with the blood of his brother to let us know that Neteyam’s blood is on Loak’s hands both figuratively and literally.

"You are too making a lot of very optimistic assumptions about what would've happened if Lo'ak didn't listen to his heroic streak when we are explicitly shown him saving 3 people in that finale - Payakan, Spider and Jake. Somehow, he should've known that it was to dangerous to do something and everything would be fine if he did nothing when we see him saving lives by doing something. You look at it from the hindsight point of view so Neteyam;s death seems inevitable result of his choice of action and other deaths may or may not have happened so dismissing the threat to others as not valid enough to rescue them is easy. However, that's now how anyone can make decisions. In the moment the decision is made there are people in danger who need help and Lo'ak tries to help them the best he can. Avoiding danger doesn't mean death toll would've been any better. Actions do have consequences but Neteyam's death isn't only consequence there. People Lo'ak saved are too.

Even if we assume Spider would stay safe with recoms he is is not with them. He was escorted by humans who just saw him crash the ship. He basically just committed a terrorist act in eyes of RDA and the recoms are too busy dying to notice or have any impact on what would happen to him after. He was by no means safe and there is no guarantee the heroes would ever get another chance to get him. Or ever see him again. This was the first time in months he was within reach, there was a battle and people dying and no one else knew or cared about Spider. Lo'ak assuming this was their one chance to free him is a pretty logical conclusion. They left him behind once before. They were not going to bad guys take him away again (and if I was assume it was Lo'ak fault recoms captured them in the woods then it makes even more sense he would won't to fix that and rescue Spider now). Even Neteyam agreed with that (all Lo'ak did to convince Neteyam to help was to say they can't leave him).

I'm not sure what are the same decisions up to the end are since after Spider's rescue all Lo'ak does is go save Jake. Saying Lo'ak should've listen to Jake and stayed put when Jake himself acknowledges Lo'ak's help was necessary is very biased interpretation of what happens. If he stayed on that rock with Neteyam's body he would've also lost a father that day. How would that make anything better? What lesson would that teach him?  

Lo'ak's main character trait is one that heroes often show - he cannot just stand by and let bad thing happen to others (be it Kiri being bullied or lives being in danger). And yes, it sometimes means the price is unbearable but his track record is still pretty good with 3:1.",0,jwuj8x7,Avatar,t3_15k6e6u,t1_jvif0r2,1692446159.0

"You are referring to complex processes similar to how clonation is for the scientific community.

The Avatar Program was designed to genetically engineer a hybrid being that resembled a natural Na’vi, but controlled by a human mind from within a safe Link Unit (quantum resonance). This allowed the controller to safely explore an environment otherwise hostile to the human body, as well as integrating with & learning from the native tribes if allowed.

These Avatars are created using an embryo containing a mixture of Na’vi genes, and human DNA from the individual who eventually would sync & activate the body. It is vital the DNA of the chosen person be of the highest quality, rigorous enough to undergo the splitting developing process as the embryo grows. Furthermore, it is such DNA which allows a human to link with their Avatar’s synapses controlling the body through neural pathways and sensory connections.

The embryos are grown in incubators which replicate the environment of the human womb, until they are fully grown. Very few viable embryos actually make it to 5 years of the stage, because the Na’vi DNA is difficult to fuse with human genomes. Those that survive will be lucky enough to sync with their human handlers once the crew made the journey from Earth to Alpha Centauri, which in favorable conditions takes around 6 years. Each successful Na’vi-Human hybrid has a value over $5,000,000,000.oo regarding is biological fusion, development, all the way to maturity.

Yes but the entire ideal of spiders character is to display the difference between adult versus child bias mentality from the experiences . Same as the entire movie is with war and conflict and sticking to rules versus feeling. This is why Jake’s son tells everyone the true story and everyone says he is wrong . The character of Kiri shows the difference is pure bias alone. Spider has stuck with them the same and they do not see him the same because of what he is not what he’s done. The end of the film shows how he knows he’ll never be the same as them even though he pretends to be comfortable with it by the way that he goes back to them and that’s the only reason that he had saved the quaritch,1,jog0eif,Avatar,t3_110awwl,t3_110awwl,1686984517.0

This dude literally went out of his way to show him where his daughters were, and he never once complained. Then when Neytiri had him at knife-point, the kid only begged for Kiri's life to be spared.

At that point, it became clear to Jake that the kid had no allegiance toward Quaritch and that he was an ally he could fully trust. 

This was a kid who was helpful during a time when Jake needed it the most, and I think it finally helped him see that this guy was way more than some ""stray pet.""

This dude truly was family.

I think this is what Jake meant when he said, ""A son for a son.""

Resources on the base are extremely expensive and in limited supply as even things made locally need raw materials or ingredients to be harvested, which diverts effort and resources away from strip mining Unobtainium. So I suspect the odds of the company being willing to put effort into successfully delivering and then successfully keeping alive the infants of regular miners and sec-ops personnel would be minimal 

That said,  I could imagine a situation where the company agrees to allow a pregnancy to continue in return for someone agreeing to sign on to another six years on Pandora, so as to avoid having to ship them back and bring out another worker to replace them.

"Lol, taught a lesson?

Neytiri had the kid at knife-point.

Spider was also resistant to giving information to the RDA, even while under torture. He only joins Quaritch because of the threat of more torture.

Then the kid is as unhelpful as possible when it comes to luring him to find Jake. 

But the kid is also dealing with a guy who is the remnant of his father. This kid has always been treated like an outside by both Jake AND Neytiri.

And he never had a place where he truly felt like he belonged. 

Despite this, the dude bent over backwards to help Jake find Tuk and Kiri. 

The kid saves Quaritch for two possible reasons:
1.) That's all that is left of his father.
2.) The dude did spare his life by letting Kiri go.

He isn't jumping for joy to do it. He considers leaving the bastard behind. He made a split emotional decision, not unlike Jake when he called Norm to revive Kiri....knowing that Quaritch was on his tail.

Not unlike Neytiri when she held Spider at knife-point.

Not unlike Lo'ak when the guy punches Anoung for messing with Kiri.

You accuse Spider of disloyalty?

The kid was begging for Kiri's life while under knife-point. 

The dude is allowed to be a human being about things.

Neytiri's attitude makes sense, but you seem awfully ready to throw Spider to the wolves as if he was actively conspiring to ruin their family.",5,j8auvuw,Avatar,t3_110awwl,t1_j8amhb2,1676243912.0

I can totally see some colonists on Bridgehead trying to tame some direhorses for transportation to use them like work animals, or trying to ride some banshees with bridles instead of tsaheylu, or some people trying to select breeding on viper wolves until they get something like dogs.

"Not a phantom limb sensation per se, I never said that, only something like it. I assume that the mental projection of driver mind to Avatar body, although accurate enough for motor function control, may not be fine enough to completely map across the entire spectrum of difference in neurological activity that exists between human and Navi brains.

Basically, different brains, different neural pathways and activity. Transferring the mental network of one mind (which evolved over tens of thousands of years in humans) to the brain of another creature entirely might open some new neural pathways and block off others.

Those blocked pathways might the site of “phantom limb” type activity — where the mind expects itself to work in one specific way, but it no longer can, hence a disconnect between what is expected to be there and what actually is (I expect my arm to move but i no longer have an arm)",6,jpdkvuh,Avatar,t3_14h81ic,t1_jpcxbj5,1687631414.0
