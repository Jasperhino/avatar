"That’s true. The proportions are of course different but the total height is a relative comparison that can be easily eye-balled, even.

Like I’m saying RW’s father comfortably reached the mid point of his son’s total height, and the humans in the avatar films don’t appear to do this to the avatars if we assume 9 ft (Robert Wadlows approximate height)

And sure, different camera focal lengths and angles and all but assuming average adult male and female heights stay consistent with current growth rates and global averages, by EYE it still looks like we’re seeing avatars and Navi who should be at least twice that length

Saying then that they’re 9 ft tall doesn’t seem to track with what we know that looks like next to a man

Again, there seems to be at least a foot height of disparity which is consistent with the OPs chart at least

I don’t think they’ve actually been scaled down any, I just think that new “lore” number was changed and now it doesn’t make sense

I mean lore is all useless anyway - it’s all subject to change - but saying they’re actually 9 feet and always have been simply doesn’t track",5,jsd8zg2,Avatar,t3_152b0vi,t1_jsd7lda,1689626502.0

"It's about being visually distinct. Webbed digits are a little overdone, but you still want something that adapts them to an aquatic environment and differentiates them physically from the forest na'vi we're familiar with.

The arm extensions (Or strakes) are unique and play off an existing association with fins and water, so we sort of can understand the role that they're supposed to play with this ocean-bound type of na'vi. They also complement the broader paddle tails, and it also means that from whatever angle you're seeing a reef na'vi from, you likely have one of those features visible and reminding you of what you're looking at.",17,j85zuey,Avatar,t3_10zo0ks,t1_j84ebde,1676153067.0

"> Oh, and one more thing, their skin color! it's so cool, I love how it matches with the ocean's color too! It's definitely such a good detail, how they can camouflage whit their skin tone!

I like that aspect (for the same reason), but their eyes being the same color gives them a less dynamic look overall than the Na'vi we got to know from the first movie. Instead of blue skin & yellow eyes, the Metkayina have the same color for skin & eyes: aquamarine/turquoise.

AkShUaLlY, it's kinda the other way around. Any tetrapod that first adapted to land primarily and THEN went back to adapt to a semi-, or fully aquatic lifestyle had its hindlimbs reduced in size, or even completely disappeared (ichthyosaurs, cetaceans), and their tails became their caudal fins.

"This is an interesting question. I've always perceived all Na'vi as basically blueish tall humans with tails. This hasn't changed with the introduction of the riff people. Morphologically the difference between the Na'vi and humans seem insignificant at all. It's easy to imagine how such ppl could live side by side on earth (which by no means less beautiful if not more than Pandora). What has always made Na'vi look human though is the way they act to go back to the question.
Their behavior is not really distinguishable from humans'. Now we're lucky humans are not very identical but there are major similarities among many. And just like humans the natives of Pandora experience strong love and other bonds like friendship/family etc. They can get aggressive and threatening and even fight. They yell, sing songs, fish and hunt and cook food as humans (fire in the second movie) - clan leaders have so far been only male, and authoritarian (they also subjugate their animals through the bont interface but that's a sep topic, it's a ""cool"" idea for a movie but not at all for real nature). 
So we're dealing with tall basically humans with tails. And tbh Na'vi diversity seems to me less expressed than human diversity, at least based on what we've seen so far. Let's not forget it's a movie - nature has had much more time to create much wider variability.
Last point, were dealing with pretty much only natives in TWOW unlike the original. Making them all act less human like might've created problems of perception. But had they chosen and been able to portray the Sullies more humanlike and the rest more different wouldve been a serious feat to achieve.

"Jake it's not the bridge between the Na'vis and the humans tho. I mean, the way I interpreted, the bridge between them should be someone who makes them reach a common ground and stop the conflict between them. But he completely rejected his humanity at the end of the first movie and as he said in TWOW, he barely has memories of his life on earth and doesnt even consider himself human (calling the RDA ""sky people"" as if he wasnt one too). 

Personally right now Lo'ak feels more of a rehash of Jake story rather than Spider: outsider who falls in love with the chief daughter, has to learn about a new culture, is the ""problematic"" sibling, lost a brother and has to ""take their place"" after their death, and will get ""betrayed"" by someone he trusted (Jake was ""betrayed"" by Quaritch, Lo'ak will feel betrayed by Spider when he learn he saved his father).

"2 things:

1. Spider/Jake. Now that Jake has effectively adopted Spider, he's going to be a much bigger part of Neytiri's life. Before WoW, she (heck, Jake too according to his narration) saw him as more of a pet. As of the end of the movie, Jake's fully embraced him as a son and we've all seen what lengths he'll go to for his family. Hopefully that includes convincing Neytiri that Spider is family now too.

2. The (reportedly) ""evil"" fire-based Na'vi coming in future of the franchise. The Na'vi are no strangers to fighting among eachother, but so far they've all been loyal to Eywa and her laws. I'm thinking/hoping these fire Na'vi go against or at least have a different view of Eywa. Something to show Neytiri that even her people have their own share of bad eggs and not everything is as cut and dry as ""my people good, sky people bad"".

"" At one point, Kiri invites Spider into a family gathering, which greatly irritates Neytiri. Neytiri views him as trouble and does not like Kiri being around him, later on trying to forbid the two from any interaction.

Neytiri had a hard time accepting Spider because she always saw him as one of the people who killed her father and destroyed her home.[4] She also entirely blames the sky people for the war that took place on Pandora a decade and a half ago; when Miles calls it ""our war"", an infuriated Neytiri says ""it is your war"" back at him. Despite Spider's arguments regarding his innocence and the fact that he had nothing to do with his parents' crimes, Neytiri ignored any words from the boy.

At the SeaDragon, in order to get Kiri back, Neytiri held Spider hostage and slightly cut him across the chest as a threat to Quaritch.

Firstly humans should stops being the one at fault, and change how they are so it's possibe for na'vi to have a different perspective on them, which is yet to happen as the invasion and imperialism is still very much happening. na'vi shouldn't ever forgive humans because humans will abuse them again and again. so the final answer is, op, nothing. because humans are unwilling to show the na'vi any other different facet and even if they did it would be disingenuous as they keep murdering and pillaging their entire planet.",0,jjupuxt,Avatar,t3_13dq9i5,t3_13dq9i5,1683884138.0

Her beliefs were/are being demonized and looked down on cuz human colonialism fears what it doesn't understand, even though they are literally able to commune with their dead through the trees. That one science guy referred to Sigourney's character's abilities as nothing other than epilepsy and hallucinations. 

I'm sorry, but believing that Neytiri can have her perspective of humans changed, feels a little like white hope.

Semantics. Besides, it was still an evil war that sent ***hundreds of thousands*** of Americans soldiers to their territory. Plus it was largely based on reaping economic profits for corporations, which is what the RDA is doing.

>So far humanity hasn't done anything to deserve this degree of charity from the Na'vi

What are on you about??? It was also humanity that saved them in the first film. Jake, Trudy, Norm, and several dozen scientists disobeyed the RDA and largely helped the Na'vi win the battle. Ewya was the big factor, of course, but it was a human that prayed to her and a human that was appointed by her to integrate.

I truly don't understand why some people in this sub are so keen on hating their own humanity so much.

"His whole squad (besides Lyle maybe) is dead. 

He was just awakened not long ago with the memories of a dead man. Forced to come back and fight for the same cause as said dead man without a say so in anything, being a practical slave to the RDA.

Quaritch was too soft, giving Jake too many chances for victory. Next time we see him I guarantee he will bring all hell down with him and show far less mercy. but he'll still hold some empathy to Spider.

To make matters worse he failed at the one job he had to do, the RDA is surely going to be disappointed in him for it.",75,ju47gqv,Avatar,t3_15dtwvh,t3_15dtwvh,1690748921.0

"Hmm let's see what has happened to Recom Quaritch by this point;

- He saw his dead human body which was left to rot in the forest and also witnessed how he died to Neytiri's arrows which gave him some PTSD.
- He met his biological son Spider for the first time, saving him from being interrogated and nearly executed by Ardmore. (see below for more details)
- He allowed his single-minded vendetta to kill Jake Sully for betraying him and Neytiri for killing him to control his actions without thinking about the fact that Spider had witnessed everything and was absolutely appalled by what his father had done to the reef Na'vi villages during the search for the Sully family.
- He took Kiri hostage to force Jake to surrender, only relenting when Neytiri threatened to kill Spider. Then he chose to fight Jake again just to settle their vendetta against each other without sparing a thought to cut his losses and fight another day by escaping the sinking Seadragon. 
- After being defeated by Jake during the fight underwater, Quaritch was saved by Spider from a watery grave and realized that it was his son who saved him and pulled him to shore. When he told Spider to leave with him back to Bridgehead, Spider instead hissed in anger and betrayal before choosing a family that would likely not accept him rather than the ghost copy of his father who he spent several months with tagging along as a mascot and interpreter. As far as Spider's concerned, the debt is repaid and he was both angered and disappointed about his father and hence chose to leave when Quaritch was  in no condition to stop him.
- And here comes the kicker; Quaritch was well and truly alone by the end of TWOW, finally realizing that his service to the RDA and vendetta against the Sully family has cost him whatever relationship he had with the only person on Pandora that he had ever cared about. Everyone else that he knew either died, left or betrayed him...and that's not counting the existential crisis of waking up in a Na'vi body after his first death. 

Quaritch may be wounded and beaten up badly, but the deepest pain was the disappointed glare on Spider's face before he turned and dived back into the ocean rather than spending one more second with him. I have a feeling we may see him have a brief breakdown in Avatar 3, basically smashing stuff up in his quarters back at Bridgehead over his failings as both a soldier and a father.",3,jucg7pt,Avatar,t3_15dtwvh,t3_15dtwvh,1690899456.0

I mean he knows how to trap them from watching the kids but has he really RIDEN on one? 4, let’s take a moment to remember that Quaritch isn’t supposed to die yet, he’s got a full character arc that ends in the fifth movie ( hopefully Lang will still be a hopping horse by then but it’s at least assumed the character will survive no matter what happens to Lang by then), and 5, everyone just fall asleep immediately and selectively when Spider fucking HISSED at mr. “ I’m not your dad but I can help” Quaritch?

That's a good point depending on how they kept the memories from Quaritch.

"Idk, I think objectively overall Jake has done a massive amount more for the Na'vi than Spider. I mean, he almost singlehandedly gathered the forces to defend the Tree of Souls, let alone all the work he's done in the years between films preparing for the RDAs return. 

In the context of just the second film, yea Jake doesn't do a lot (since it's not his story), but let's not pretend Spider did a lot beyond spectate for most of the movie (not like he had a choice). even I'd say any up he got on Jake in terms of helpfulness is instantly destroyed by his decision to spare Quaritch. 

I like Spider, but he's a 16 year old kid who is in over his head. Saying that he's done more to help than Toruk Makto is just daft imo.",5,k3bjxt0,Avatar,t3_16yexws,t1_k3achfo,1696358961.0

"Note, this is my opinion only, but:

Quadritch is his dad.

Quadritch saved him from torture (be it for good reasons or not he still did it)

Quadritch at least somewhat cared about him when Spider was obviously neglected by the Sullies and he still ran back to them.

They spent months bonding together, and quadritch again showed some interest in the neglected kid.
Quadritch had saved his life minutes prior to Miles saving him.

He is sixteen. You cannot expect a sixteen year old to be okay to watch impassively as their own dad drowns when they have the opportunity to help right here.

Stockholm syndrome exists. If People in the real world got Stockholm syndrome when faced with actual monsters willing to hurt them, what reasons are there to think a kid like Miles would not have it?

Objectively, it is definitely black and white, but on an individual level, it is never that simple, there absolutely are gray areas. You cannot just flip a switch and hate someone when you've already bonded with them, even if logically you know you should. That is not how most humans work. Especially not neglected kids. 

What he did was defo wrong, but even then, he would need guidance, not hate. Spider absolutrly had reaso.s to feel internal conflicts. Also, seeing how he ditched Quadritch right after saving him, I do not think he would be willing to go back to him and leave the sullies behind.  I do not think he is a traitor (not like that anyways)


Also: Neytiri does not know what Spider did like we do. So why is she right for treating Spider like she does? Why is Jake wrong?

 I would argue that maybe had Neytiri treated him better in the first place, then maybe Miles would have never saved Quadritch. He would have been less vulnerable/likely to getting attached to the first na'vi looking adult he sees that shows him they at least care a little. 

Again that is my opinion, and I could be wrong.",13,k39ctji,Avatar,t3_16yexws,t1_k390jqx,1696323456.0

"First movie was to set up Pandora's Lore, Jake and Neytiri characters and to start their story.
Second movie was to set up Jake's family, to introduce new concepts like new environments and cultures, and to ""create"" Quaritch.

With those already set up, the next movies will be characters and Pandora's development, evolving the story as we go. Remember me of HBO's GoT and HoTD, where the first season is to show us the universe where the history is set, and the sequences just keep giving us MORE, on all senses. I trust Cameron to do better than GoT and to end this saga the way it deserves.

The state of humanity at the start of A1 strongly speaks to the point. Humans continue down the same trajectory, unchanged regardless of Pandora. Using up all the resources, overcrowding, fighting. Pandora isn't seen by most powers as anything other than a resource to exploit, and delay the endgame.

Finding life outside of earth is supposed to be profoundly shattering to our understanding of our place in the universe, and should change our entire ""worldview.""

"I firmly believe that quaritch is only a person of nurture, not nature, and when he is no longer in the environment pushing him to do what he does, he will flail like a fish before jumping into the waters of pandora.  

We all know, if the RDA succeeds, and if they wipe out avv the vegetation and natives, and make it a new earth, nobody will need the recoms, they'll be killed.

They just don't know it yet. Their only value is the fact that their blue, and they use that to their advantage against Pandora's immune system.

If you've ever seen the Disney move strange world, I think of pandora like that.",4,kk4uszg,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t3_1adhvx0,1706550770.0

He already is. It’s just a matter of time before he turns full Navi.,3,kk3mdea,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t3_1adhvx0,1706534214.0
"I'm pretty sure he's going to fall in love with Varang and drift towards the na'vi. Ardmore will see where things are going and attempt to backstab him. This and other reasons leads to him fighting alongside Jake during the end of A3.

However come A4 we will see his team is still humanity and he will ensure that RDA remain on Pandora, settling into somewhere between both factions",5,kk2rhr8,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t3_1adhvx0,1706513455.0
Of course. That's the whole point of making him not human over a four movie arc.,2,kk397nz,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t3_1adhvx0,1706526638.0
"I wouldn’t change his personality 

But make him morally grey and question what’s going on. At the end of the series, I wouldn’t want him to join some tribe and dressing up like that and such. But I would want him to be on his own, live off the land, and keeping some of his old uniform.",2,kk4ey88,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t3_1adhvx0,1706545483.0
"I think he will become a more gray character over time. It's pretty clear he will be the villain in the next movie and probably the next one will still be dealing with him. I don't think he will go through a full redemption arc but by the end of the series will have realized the futility of his actions and his character will be broken. He will realize his status as an outsider to both the humans and the Na'Vi.

He is pretty much a direct foil to Jake (and more indirectly, to Spider and Kiri) but 'made wrong,' so to speak. Whereas Jake earned his permanent place as a Na'Vi fighting for their survival, Quaritch became a Na'Vi by failing to genocide them and then having his mind copied (rather than transferred). Jake embraced the Na'Vi's way of life genuinely, while Quaritch just wants to find the useful parts of it that will help him kill. His existence is like a sick, unnatural twisting of Jake Sully's own existence.",2,kk9ua1e,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t3_1adhvx0,1706630545.0

I do think that we will get an Empire Strikes Back level of WTF with one of the sequel endings. I can’t imagine Quaritch won’t end one of those films with a major victory.,1,kk4w0q4,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t3_1adhvx0,1706551173.0
I don’t think so because of his motivations. He knows his human body is dead but I don’t think he will identify with the Na’vi,1,kk52qp0,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t3_1adhvx0,1706553414.0

I wonder if this will be his arc going forward.,1,kk88jac,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t3_1adhvx0,1706598846.0
Probably. It seems that’s the path that he’s destined to take in the end,1,kp0a7sr,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t3_1adhvx0,1707128531.0
"Does Colonel Miles Quaritch deserve redemption after Avatar The Way of Water? Having seen the film myself, I don't think so because this is a clone that has all the memories (except for the final battle) and all the personality of the original Miles. This means that essentially, he is the same person as the original, and had he survived his final battle in the first film, he would have displayed the same redeeming qualities as his clone because they share the exact same personality. The reason why the clone doesn't remember the colonel's final moments is because the memories were downloaded before the final battle, so of course the clone is not going to remember the moments after the memories were extracted. Although the Navi clone may have different personalities, but still has the exact same personality and memories as the original Miles and therefore, we have to assume that any redeeming quality he shows, is something the original Miles would have displayed if he had survived his final battle.",1,kpzlzy7,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t3_1adhvx0,1707686183.0

"I want to see this so bad. And I think we will. Storytelling-wise, I don't see any other realistic reason to bring Quaritch back in a Na'vi body besides to explore him gaining a different perspective. We're already beginning to see the shift in him after seeing him connect to Spider and seeing Neytiri be the violent, irrational one.",8,kk4wnqt,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t1_kk1j437,1706551387.0
real,1,kop5r7w,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t1_kk1j437,1706936388.0
I think that's what the ash tribe will be used for. Quaritch ended the movie pretty hurt and not doing so good. I think he's gonna get nursed back to health by the ash tribe and he's gonna start seeing things from a different perspective via them. The ash tribe might potentially be more open technology and change which provides a better entry point for Quaritch to be willing to learn and an easy way for Na'vi to end up fighting other Na'vi.,6,kk4xddn,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t1_kk2jtqr,1706551627.0

"FYI, the whole reason they brought Quaritch back in a Na'vi body is because every time they tried to enter Pandora wilderness, they were attacked by the fauna. Humans are viewed as a virus now by Eywa with probably exception of Norm and all them. They used Na'vi bodies to get in undetected and not have every animal attack them.",7,kk4y672,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t1_kk303ka,1706551896.0
"ya exactly, he wil never be a human again",1,kop5vs4,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t1_kka81cd,1706936456.0
"I don't see how it wouldn't end up like this. He doesn't have a human body to go back to... I guess unless they made grew him one, which is possible, but I very much doubt they will.

So... in a Na'vi body, he would be an outcast on base and couldn't realistically go live back on earth since he can't breath our air.

I for one, can't wait.",1,kk4ywkb,Avatar,t3_1adhvx0,t1_kk4116a,1706552141.0

"I understand James Cameron influence in avatar has a bit of Hinduism in the mix. But man, I see so much Christianity similarities, maybe it’s mostly incidental but maybe Cameron’s history ok with Christianity that spills in a bit??

In both movies, Eywah (Yahweh?😂) is not distant from creation, rather cares for it primarily the the Navi (humans) who are supposed to be proper care takers & govern the Pandora (earth) accordingly. They are living along side of Eywa in proper tune, the same how Humanity walks along side god governing his creation in the garden of Eden. 
Eywa herself is apart of the bonding process of the monogamous marriage process in the first movie, just as the Church has long seen marriage as a sacred event- a sacrament!

Also it is repeated in both movies that Eywa holds their ancestors in her heart, and even those presently alive are connected in Eywa, the same as God’s children being held together in the communion of his church, actively being the body the Christ and connected in Christ with the saints of the past!

" Yes, indeed !

Kiri , i simply love Her with my Consciosness and with my Soul !!! 

Because Kiri Is , from Spiritual point of view, directly bond to Eywa. Therefore, She can control and/or communicate with every single one of Nature's elements ! 

I will make a bold supposition, that Kiri's Father is Eywa herself. 

Kiri is not only a Druid, or a Tsahik, as u call them in Avatar, but a fully fledged Sacred Being or a Prophecy Child. 

It's almost like Jesus Christ, having God's powers and abilities! 

Could be Eywa Herself, taking human form, when Kiri will be fully grown. 

This is, practically, the Real Lore about the Virgin Marry left pregnant without a husband ! Basically it's the same Lore, where God Consciosness of the Universe , in fact the Masculine Divine Principle can do a pregnancy. The Masculine Divine Principle of the Mother Nature, of the God. The ""fun fact"" is that the Feminine Divine Principle, which is, in fact, The Great Mother or The Cosmic Mother, first, gives birth to the Masculine Divine Principle. And then, it's possible to make the Virgin Marry birth miracle!!! 

   
 

P.S. 1 A small joke: I just read the Bible, when i saw this line: ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Kiri, shall be saved. !!!"" 

P.S. 2 This could be a joke for us, but for Na'Vi's it just could be THE REAL THING ! Marry Christmas! to all and : Kiri be with u !

Yes indeed :) Kiri is the Prophecy Child, the Chosen One and the Lore of the Miracle Birth!

Kiri , i simply love Her with my Consciosness and with my Soul !!! 

Because Kiri Is , from Spiritual point of view, directly bond to Eywa. Therefore, She can control and/or communicate with every single one of Nature's elements ! 

I will make a bold supposition, that Kiri's Father is Eywa herself. 

Kiri is not only a Druid, or a Tsahik, as u call them in Avatar, but a fully fledged Sacred Being or a Prophecy Child. 

It's almost like Jesus Christ, having God's powers and abilities! 

Could be Eywa Herself, taking human form, when Kiri will be fully grown. 

This is, practically, the Real Lore about the Virgin Marry left pregnant without a husband ! Basically it's the same Lore, where God Consciosness of the Universe , in fact the Masculine Divine Principle can do a pregnancy. The Masculine Divine Principle of the Mother Nature, of the God. The ""fun fact"" is that the Feminine Divine Principle, which is, in fact, The Great Mother or The Cosmic Mother, first, gives birth to the Masculine Divine Principle. And then, it's possible to make the Virgin Marry birth miracle!!! 

   
 

P.S. 1 A small joke: I just read the Bible, when i saw this line: ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Kiri, shall be saved. !!!"" 

P.S. 2 This could be a joke for us, but for Na'Vi's it just could be THE REAL THING ! Marry Christmas! to all and : Kiri be with u ! 

P.S. 3 Do you believe in Kiri ??? ... because: I do !!! Kiri is my Heart-bond Character in, basically, all of the Avatar Franchise until now, and for sure, TO THE END OF AVATAR FRANCHISE!!!",1,j1l0ilw,Avatar,t3_zoy80q,t1_j1g50op,1671946952.0

"There had been five toruk makto before Jake, so I wonder why did the na’vi need those heroes to begin with. Neytiri speaks about a time of great sorrow, and that her grandfather’s grandfather united the clans… but why? Why did he need to gather them? Against who? That was long before the human went to Pandora. 

I’m fact… 2023, Jake goes to Pandora in 2148, 125 years from now on… so right now, in Pandora, Neytiri’s ancestor is becoming Toruk Makto 😅🥰",61,j71bvdu,Avatar,t3_10sgmzp,t3_10sgmzp,1675421252.0
"Its my theory that the Na'vi are based on the Indigenous tribes of Southern Ontario, where James Cameron grew up, and formed the idea of Pandora.

The Anishinaabe specifically.  

(naabe is phonetically the same as Na'vi)

If this is true, then the Wars they had with the Iroquois are the stuff of legend, and match up closely with Avatar.

The Anishinaabe first came in contact with the Whites in 1620.  But growth in America drove the Iroquois into their area, and they had epic brawls.

Later, they'd defend and push back the Sioux.

By the time the war of 1812 rolled around, they were firm allies of the British against the American invaders.

It was estimated that at the time war was declared, there were 8410 warriors of the “Western Indians.” The Western Indians included Ojibwe, Odawa, Potowatomi, Huron, Shawnee, Mississaugas, Nipissings and Algonkians. The Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potowatomi made up 7410 of this number, an overwhelming majority. So even though the Shawnee participated, and their war chief is the one most associated with the war, it was the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe, Odawa, Potowatomi) that formed the majority. Unfortunately, they do not receive much attention or credit, they are absent from popular consciousness.

After the War of 1812, Britian would renag on its treaties, and by 1824 the Anishinaabe would be on reservations.

And why did that happen?  Because after the War of 1812, British expansion from Settlers exploded in a now peaceful Southern Ontario.

And those first Settlers?  You guessed it.  James Camerons great great great great Grandfather.  Who cleared the first homestead in 1824.  And that farm is where James Cameron spent his summers as growing up.",26,j71r996,Avatar,t3_10sgmzp,t3_10sgmzp,1675431057.0

One thing is breaking someone's will and mind and making them obey. Bringing them to believe in your cause and fight for you fiercely on their own is quite another. Swarm are like that. Low key and really not aggressive. But if you threaten them and make yourself a threat - pray. 

What good do starships and nukes do you in a fight against the opponent who makes your own people betray you and stand against you? Weapons are still operated by people.

Did you notice how Eywa goes out of her way to NOT piss humans off by the way? She is rather friendly and merciful even after a battle, letting humans who want to stay - stay and live normally. Letting wounded and beaten enemies... Even their leader who started it! Leave in peace.

 >Pantheism is the belief that reality, the universe and the cosmos are identical with divinity and a supreme supernatural being or entity, pointing to the universe as being an immanent creator deity still expanding and creating, which has existed since the beginning of time, or that all things compose an all-encompassing, immanent god or goddess and regards the universe as a manifestation of a deity. This includes all astronomical objects being viewed as part of a sole deity. The worship of all gods of every religion is another definition but is more precisely termed Omnism.

And yes, I also think the avatar movies are quite spiritual; Not only did JImbo put all sorts of references to the bible into the movie (especially twow), but he shows how deeply everything the Na'vi do is linked to their beliefs, and their environment.

"I can totally understand why Neytiri and Jake holds so much pride in Neteyam. I've read in the Visual Dictionary that before the war the only thing Neteyam had going on was the healthy rivalry/competition he has with Lo'ak as a warrior.

I feel like Neteyam was the beginning of the good thing Jake and Neytiri can have after the war. He was the physical embodiment of their love with no boundaries. 

From the book as well, it shows that Neteyam and Tuk are easily Jake and Neytiri's favorite not because they don't have 5 fingers like an avatar but the typical firstborn and youngest child favoritism. 

Kiri and Lo'ak are obviously middle children (they're somewhat twins but Kiri's older). Kiri's the type who is fine regardless if she isn't the favorite because she has the self-confidence (not until the Metkayina tribe. I feel like Kiri and Lo'ak never faced prejudice as half-breeds until they arrived at the Metkayina tribe)

"Loved the bullying scene with Neteyam. It really showed how not only could he deescalate the situation without violence but he even demands that moving forward they respect kiri. I personally thought that little comment showed how mature he is for his age. He truly was an old soul even at his young age. It isn’t until he is forced into brotherly obligation to fight for lo’ak that things then take a turn for the worse. He always bailed his sibling out of dangerous situations, never once complaining how he was dragged into them. Even when he has a busted lip from the fight lo’ak dragged him into, his first instinct is to still protect lo’ak and try to take the blame. Even when he got dragged into saving spider, he takes the gun from lo’ak so that he can buy him time to escape the boat, ultimately sacrificing himself. When you really think about it, it’s heart wrenching to watch another kid that’s only 1 year older having to fight like that. He’s clearly scared but all that goes out the window for his family’s saftey. He never complains and even when lo’ak and Jake both unfairly unload on him, he holds his own anger in for fear of saying something that will hurt either of them, especially lo’ak with the payakan scene. He takes Lo’aks “perfect son” comment, which clearly hurts him, and visibly struggles to not say anything hurtful back. What is there not to love about a character like that? I also love the detail on Lo’ak’s  face whenever Neteyam defends or protects him from Jakes chastising or from the bullies. You can see his body language deflate in relief and how he lets his brother step in front of him and watches. At the end of the day you can see that lo’ak is a 14 year old who just really admires and needs his big bro in those moments. I only wish Lo’ak had learned from the first 3 times of almost killing his family members, Neteyam would surely be alive. (Sorry y’all we can admit lo’ak is just a kid AND accept that he did in fact get Neteyam killed and that Jake’s disappointment in him was valid each time. those things aren’t exclusive) However, I get that that’s part of Lo’aks journey. All in all Neteyam was a fantastic character and JC did a good job making us love his noble, protective and humble demeanor in such a short time, allowing his death to still hurt. Neteyam was my favorite of ATWOW, but I don’t think he should come back.

My main theory is that we're gonna learn the na'vi used to be as advanced as humanity. They created Eywa, unobtanium, and genetically modified every species on the planet to connect with each other. They decided a long time ago it's better to live as hunter gatherers for whatever reason. Maybe they decided space travel wasn't worth it, maybe they had their own ecological disaster.

If the Navi were once advanced, I think they would have probably used more of a bio engineering technique to create eywa, that’s even IF they did. Pandora is hinted (possibly said, I don’t remember) to be a lot older than earth. It would make sense for life to eventually evolve to be more connected and complex. I don’t doubt that eywa runs deep in the ground, I think eywa is more of something that is spread out among all living things on Pandora. I think eywa is like an awareness like Grace said. It’s like a group of organisms combining to create a version of antibodies against humans, then the humans creating a virus (avatars) that can disguise as a part of the body (planet).

3. A battle takes place where the Na’vi are so close to pushing the Sky People off Pandora for good, only to be betrayed and this results in the destruction of all the soul/spirit trees, cutting the Na’vi off from Eywa, and the Sky People gain the upper hand from this point onwards.

my theory is that the leaked titles for the sequel 3 and 4 are actually in the wrong order.

we know that Neytiri is the focus of A5, and probably the narrator too. which leaves Kiri as the protagonist and narrator for A4. in this case, the Seed Bearer being the title for A4 makes more sense. also Kiri is probably the daughter or the avatar of Eywa, as hinted in A2.

so she is the seed bearer, which means she has the ability as a god-like Navi, to regenerate nature. Sully mentioned to Eywa in A1 that humans killed their mother. maybe Eywa birthed Kiri as a kind f messiah to save Earth by reviving their dead ""mother"" aka nature, and unite humans and Navi.

Like, there doesn't seem to be any hatred or annoyance or anything between them, they simply don't really hang out compared to Spider and Kiri and Lo'ak.

Yea it did take him time to adjust being Na’vi. In the comic it shows him battling an identity crisis in his mind. It shows him looking at himself still as human even though he isn’t anymore. See before he wasn’t fully an Avatar. If he died in his Avatar body he would just wake back up in his human body. Now that he fully transferred over to being a Na’vi. If he dies now he going to Eywa heaven. If I was in Jake Sully position I would probably make the same choice of joking the Na’vi. He got his legs back and he has a family now.  What I’ve been wondering if maybe they could take his brother DNA and restore him like they did with Quaritch. That would be crazy 🧐🧐.

"Spider was awesome.

"Well, we’ll be insane together, because I don’t get it either. 

I had already seen some hatred for the character before watching the movie, so I went expecting him to be bad some way or another. Imagine my suprise when he was neither.

For me, Spider is one of the more complex characters of the story and probably one of the most conflicted too, which I like. 

Most of the hating towards him doesn’t make a lick of sense. It’s the type that’s gonna die down instantly once/if he gets an Avatar and becomes “hot” for the edits. LOL",19,j53uf3s,Avatar,t3_10gcv48,t3_10gcv48,1674190959.0
"Spider is not traitor. He could have told them the location of the secret base at any time, but clearly tells Quaritch he has no intention of helping him. 

Getting along means little. Many children ”get along” with super abusive parents, way worse than what Quarich did to him up to that point.

He teaches them a little language and where the Ikrans are. Not really a big deal, and something any local would know. 

In the end he does not let Quaritch die, not because he is on his side, but because Spider has a moral compass and is a good person. You know theres an active war in Ukraine, and even there the Ukranians tend to wounded enemies.

Yet he casually ignored Spider (well at least he wasn’t straight up hostile like Ney’tiri). As I emphasised in another post; you cannot bury your past! It will come back to haunt you!

">In the story, months passed from the time Spider was kidnapped until the end of the film, which means that he and Quaritch spent a lot of time together. 

To be fair, this is unclear in the movie. I don't know why it wasn't paced/edited better, but it was poorly done, imo. And the fact that nearly everyone is confused about this part is evidence to that.

Spider feels like he is switching sides because it *looks* like he adopts a friendlier attitude towards Quaritch almost immediately, without buildup, and then just as quickly remembers that they're actually still enemies. 

I know we can logically deduct that it probably happened gradually, but it's not obvious from the movie. It could've been done much better and I'm upset it wasn't since I really care for their dynamic.",3,j53d6ak,Avatar,t3_10gcv48,t3_10gcv48,1674182630.0
"The older I get, the more I realize most of an audience it's actually full of sh#t one way or the other. Either they're more concerned about their social standing by repeating the general consensus instead of having a personal take, OR, they doy have a personal opinion but in most cases either their attention span or their interpretation capabilities are not great.

This is how you end up with either ""Jurassic World 3"" or ""Pretentious movie that wins all the awards but it's never heard of ever again because nobody actually enjoyed watching it"".

And I don't want to be elitist about this. I don't care what they spend their time on as long as they enjoy it and are happy about it. It's just the general vibe I get from this things. For instance, I know many people (professional people) that didn't get what the ending of Life of Pi was all about, even when the movie literally explains it to you. Try to remember about those people who just weren't great at literature analysis in school, some people just kind of suck at it.

And then of course, on the other side of things, you have things like Avatar, in which ""is cool"" to complain about ""cliche"" and ""repetitive"" story. But then you hear those people reviews about The Force Awakens and they never once complain about ""cliche"" or ""Repetitive"".

"It is unfair to call spider a traitor , because he isn’t if he was he would have left with quaritch and not gone back with the sullys. I wholeheartedly agree with you. Can we stop with this whole “Spider wasn’t raised by the sullys” thing? You do not become feral and legitimately think you’re na’vi from being raised by humans. Also where is this idea where everyone is saying Jake thinks that’s spider is annoying and doesn’t like him if anything he shows that he somewhat cares for him as he defends him when neytiri says she wants him gone. Selfridge himself said that they would take his memories and personality and transfer it into the avatar , he is the same person when we’re talking about his memories and personality. Spider is human and the son of Col quaritch, I’m pretty sure Jake knew he would be fine and at the possibility would go after him. Neytiri was never going to kill spider, she knows how close spider and kiri are and wouldn’t want another child to leave them. I do agree he is a morally grey character. Also it is irredeemable, the man he let go has a billion dollar company backing him up, is extremely experienced in war, is ruthless as shown wanting to kill an innocent metakayina as well as burning down their houses, holding a knife and threatening to kill your best friend(kiri), said “I’m never gonna stop hunting you down not until your whole family is dead” right in front of your face.

I’m fine with his character beats and plot points and look forward to seeing what they do with the character going forward.  My main problem is the dreadlocks.

But the movie is a visual masterpiece, so I can understand why some people might miss some of these details.

>Spider feels like he is switching sides because it *looks* like he adopts a friendlier attitude towards Quaritch almost immediately, without buildup, and then just as quickly remembers that they're actually still enemies.

Yes, I agree to an extent. Their relationship could've been way better explored, but then I feel like the rest of the movie would be longer than it already is (apparently, TWOW and the third film were one big script that they had to split in two). But even then, I think it still works because at this point, Spider didn't actually get to see Quaritch's evil side, so it can be viewed as ""When he was starting to think that maybe he wasn't that bad, he does all that fucked up shit on the village"" and that's why he ""quickly remembers that they're still enemies"".

My memory is fuzzy, but I believe it's the same scene where Quaritch informs him of the tracker in his helmet. So... pretty much right after their interrogation? A little early to be having fun (but perhaps I'm misremembering)

Another one is when they're taming the flying creatures and Quaritch falls off the cliff.

"It’s part of a genre in western art you might call “going native”.

Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, Dances with Wolves, The New World, Dune—and yes, Pocahontas—are just some of the films that use the concept as a blueprint.

The problem with this kind of analysis is that there are very few films with an “original” plot. Films that genuinely rewrote the language of cinema—like Abel Gance’s Napoleon, Solaris, Satantango—are usually unknown by the general moviegoing public, and especially by smart-alecks who make YouTube videos about how Avatar RiPpEd ofF FeRnGuLLy.

"Since my earliest days I've had an inexplicable love for life (human and non-human), despite how nasty nature can be sometimes; and also a desire to explore, learn about, and protect said life & nature. Avatar reminded me that the forests I knew growing up had friends near and far who were suffering at human hands, and that people need them and their creatures as much as they need the people. Eywa was beautiful and healthy, but Terra (that's what I call Gaia, the biosphere) was dying. And so another case of PADS came to be.

I didn't let that get me down, though. Rather, Avatar inspired me to encourage and inspire others to love and care for Terra and their fellow humans & non-humans, with the hope that my efforts might save at least one animal, or child, or community, or forest, so that this Earth might be just a little more beautiful. That's why I created the website/community [CytoLuminescent](https://www.cytoluminescent.com), and education is a part of that as well.

In short, Terra spoke to me, and I listened. After all, if other organisms and even cells can give light, why can't we?

More Neytiri, especially giving her more time to grieve her home, and grieve in general.

Develop Neteyam more, having the attention mostly on Lo'ak somewhat dampened the emotional impact of Neteyams death, specifically for him as an individual, rather than just something happening to the family

2)I also wouldn’t have Brought big Q back or made kiri a grace clone or have made a whole movie on the water.

Let Jake show a little humility learning to ride a tsurak, since this isn't his first rodeo learning a new way and he's mostly grown past the Jarhead showboating. Let the kids have moments where they can talk and share their culture, instead of it being just one-way. Maybe the battle-moms make a truce to help their daughters weave something wholly new, of both people.

"The Amrita plot is another macguffin on top of another macguffin that amounts to nothing.

I would rewrite the movie to show us what happened during the year skip. I would merge Lo'ak and Spider into one character so that Neteyam and Spider would be spirit brothers, Spider is the one befriending Payakan as he's an outcast for Omaticayas and Metkayinas all alike. We wouldn't know that Spider is Quaritch's son for sure until the final showdown. I'd show Spider sneakily escaping from the base but on Quaritch's volition to track down the Sullys.

I would cut down the kids wandering underwater down to one montage.

I wouldn't have made the final showdown happen at the 3 brothers rocks. I would have written the third act so Jake surrenders so he can free the kids. As the Seadragon goes back to Bridgehead, Neytiri and the whole family alongside the Metkayinas and Payakan decide to save Jake and Spider while both highjack the ship deciding to crash it on Bridgehead's gates in a suicide mission. Neteyam dies a martyr as he covers his dad during the final battle happening as the Seadragon is about to crash and Ardmore sends forces to prevent it.

"I would have highlighted a bit more about Spider's experience growing up on Pandora to contrast Lo'ak. It would have been interesting to see Spider talking about his mom and giving the audience more information on who she was, just to give him a bit more depth. I know it's in the comics but for the people who didn't read them, just a simple scene or two would have made him easier to understand. If they had wanted the audience to believe that he was ""like a son"" or just trying to fit in, I would have liked to have seen him talking about his mom and trying to find that in Neyteri. 

I would have given more interactions with different characters to get a better dynamic on who they all were, especially the kids. I would have liked to have seen the older kids talking about how much pressure it is to live up to their father, for example. It also would have been nice to see more Ronal, especially since she wasn't sure about letting the family stay with them and bonding with Neyteri or maybe even Kiri. 

Also...I wish that Jake would have talked about how different Earth was to Pandora and how he grew up. Was his dad a hard ass with him and his brother?

"If I could have a fan fiction alternative to Cameron's vision, I'd like to see one where humanity isn't so completely corporate barbarian in its behavior.

My reaction is that aside from a few ineffectual scientist types, almost every human is depicted as a soulless soldier/worker bee or is a dyed in the wool Corporate executive. Corporatists so concerned with profit that they can't even comprehend that their plans are morally objectionable.

The domination of that Corporatist extractive outlook is so complete that there seems to be not even a shred of Public Relations worry about the reaction of people back home to the genocidal depredations humanity is inflicting on its newest neighbors.

For example, that massive cargo module's landing mechanic is not going to be a secret. It could only be deployed in that fiery fashion. So attentive folks back in the Sol system would have had evidence of at least indifference to the damage such a technique would inflict on Pandora.

So I'd like Avatar to have been a little less simplistic in the 'humans bad' portrayal of things. At least to the point I'd expect bad stories getting back home would rile up some amount of legal controversy inconvenient to the Corporate types.

"As someone who isn’t aware of Avatar Lore, the story didn’t make total sense. I’ve watched it 3 times now but maybe I missed things?? 

So did humans mine the metal under the big tree they destroyed? 

Neytiri got a new flying dragon pet after her’s died? I thought you only match with one for life, no? 

It wasn’t obvious when or how Spider was born because he must have been a toddler in the first movie but was never mentioned. They just made subtle hints at who his father was until you eventually put it together but they literally could have just said, ‘you’re not like Quaritch’. 

Also Spider’s character and personality. I *think* he’s supposed to be young (like 13?) and unsure of himself but instead he comes across as a spineless 20 year old. 
Him and Kiri are so close but we don’t see why and how close? Is this a romantic love or sibling love?
Maybe give him some pants once he’s captured. 

The whale going all Free-Willy was fun, I didn’t hate it but it was a *little* on the nose. 

It didn’t show when or why they killed the Tulkun calf. 

How anyone understands what the Tulkun are saying and how Lo’ak goes from not understanding either to suddenly being fluent in whale grunt. 

Where did the reef people disappear to in the fight? They literally peace out and left the Sully’s to die. 

Neytiri is portrayed too much as a moody, heartless heel dog. Was she actually going to kill Spider or just faking it? 

More on the recon’s for sure. I like them. Maybe a bit of something on how they deal mentally and emotionally with suddenly waking up as a different species and get told that they actually died 10+ years ago, they’ll never go back to earth, never see their loved ones (if they’re still alive) or now adult children.

Jake lied and betrayed the mission to help humanity survive, and in the eyes of the military that’s the worst thing a person can do. 
To just head-shot him from afar wouldn’t be enough for Quaritch. Which is why he openly says he wants to not only kill Jake but kill his family, his innocent children too.",4,jgma1c0,Avatar,t3_12onyya,t1_jgjlndj,1681743718.0

First movie was ""I see you"" about seeing and understanding the ""other"".

""Way of the water"" is, I guess, anyone can understand on his own. My understanding is ""There is no beginning and no end. We are all born from water and return to water when we die. This is life."" Basically ""Way of the water"" Is not unlike our Earth Stoicism philosophy. 

Jake was afraid initially to lose his family and wanted to protect his tribe. He understood that fighting Sky People in big battles like last time - is pointless and suicidal now. Not even massive intervention by Eywa will help against plasma from orbit. 

But after losing his son, battle with Whalers, salvation by Kiri... Jake grew to accept that the fight is already happening. Running from fate is pointless and painful.

"I'm aware, to some greater or lesser degree, of this ongoing and historic truth. Millions have died and vast disruptions to existing societies and real world ecosystems have been inflicted to secure economic gain for the relative few back home.

That is nothing remotely new (as with your mention of the Middle East and my thoughts of empires both modern and ancient) and perhaps I shouldn't find the humans in Avatar to be a violation of the uncanny valley - but I do. Mostly because I've got a thing for Corporate entities being wired in a somewhat inhuman fashion to value cancerous growth above survival of the societies they operate within.

This somewhat unrelated take on how our real world society operates intrudes into how I perceive the lockstep human laborers and especially the top Corporates of Avatar vs. a more cantankerous and bickering humanity comprised of several conflicting sets of goals and values. Amongst those mixed goals being some concerned groups raising a potential ruckus about Pandora's genocidal exploitation.

The Corporates of the world of Avatar have the technology to save Earth (that rapid production technology and those swarming builder bots were powerful capabilities)  but not the will to apply it back home for the betterment of society. They're growth obsessed profit hunting entities with relatively anemic concerns for the long term survival of the worlds that support them.

That profit over survival stance is the one I find somewhat uncanny - especially when the corporatist individuals not only defer to that stance (which at least they have an economic incentive to do) but also seem incapable of even conceptualizing a different way of viewing things - even if only for public relations damage control reasons.

That the Corporate entities in the universe of Avatar don't seemingly have to worry about public relations is one key way I find the humans of these movies distressingly inhuman.

More informally, that corporate suit talking about ""Look at all that Cheddar"" in the first film really bugged me.

More construction/innovation wouldn’t help. But then they set out to colonize a new planet in the exact same destructive way.
Whale hunting is banned on Earth so why isn’t it on Pandora? Why is killing civilians not illegal on Pandora? Again we are left to assume. I assume that it’s because it’s isolated from the eyes of Earth and they are too far away to dictate laws or impose punishment anyway. They can get away with anything so they do whatever they want; it’s in the name of saving humans as a species so there’s no price too high. And they do genuinely care more about getting rich, getting a fancy new place to live and never aging than they do about the people and the place before them. Exactly like how America was made. It’s just a dig at humanity and how we never learn. How we just consume and pollute even though we don’t necessarily want to destroy the Earth, but we don’t care because it’s someone else’s problem and we don’t want to miss out.

"I'll disagree with you regarding the technology being *unable* to address or mitigate Earth's woes or that signs of what's going on at Pandora would be fully invisible to interested parties back home. 

Regarding the problem of operations on Pandora being out of sight of possible protests by those on Earth, I'll once again reference the enormous cargo module we saw in the movie. Anybody back on Earth who'd be able to notice that large module being affixed to the starships could work out that it could only be delivered by that impressively destructive delivery method we saw in the movie. So there is at least some evidence for interested parties to find back in our territory.

Regarding something like global warming, one mechanistic approach would be to position a system of sunshades to reflect some of the sun's output. This would seemingly be within the space and automated construction capacities we've seen in Avatar and especially the sequel. This doesn't address collapsing ecosystems directly nor a myriad of other topics, but it might be a point of control to ameliorate the problem for a time. 

Furthermore, those robotic building systems were deeply impressive. That sort of productivity could do a lot to address problems if well focused, and the productivity wouldn't have to be on Earth. The rest of Solar system is host to many worlds and the resources to build orbital infrastructure throughout the system that could also positively address factors back on Earth.

So I'm not convinced that it is beyond the scope of Earth's technologies to address the concerns of Earth dying in that time, more that the key Corporatist players are too tightly in control of Earth's economic realm and still too cancerously focused on those arcane metrics of growth to actually harness that technology in service to Earth's society and her ecosphere.

By the way, thank you for the comments. I've enjoyed this chat.

Re-summarizing: Ultimately the movie is portraying a villainous advanced power treading upon a fairly idealized world of non industrialized aliens.

That would be too much because there wouldn’t be a Na’vi equivalent that matches our speech unless Jake taught them these things.

I find Neteyam’s accent more jarring than any slang used since it matches no one else in the family.  It’s even stronger than Neytiri’s accent.  Personally, it’s surprising how many people focus on the “bro and cuz” over this.",2,jgmgym6,Avatar,t3_12onyya,t1_jgmfegq,1681746575.0
"Yea you’re right, with the amount of technology they exhibit in the movie they must have made insane advancements and the implications and applications of those advancements leave little that couldn’t be fixed on Earth. 
I do think the movie tried to give the impression there was some sort of underlying moral reason to be so destructive at least in the second movie, but I did admit I was filling in a lot of the blanks and made assumptions and maybe they weren’t implied. 
And your point is bolstered even more by the fact that they essentially brought humans back from the dead as a new species and then they got right back to work following immoral orders without skipping a beat. 
Considering they hint at Quaritch having some affection for Spider, maybe in the next movie we will see more humanity from humanity. 
If they really are bringing civilian humans to live on Pandora we might see the corporate forces acting a little more accountable and less dystopian?

The fourth and fifth images were really interesting, in the fourth I think she looks like Jake, around the eyes especially, so it's like she's Jake and then turn into Neytiri for a moment. She is crying on the rocks, holding Neteyam's hand to her face, so she's not completely emotionally numb or anything. I think she was just trying to be brave during the funeral and say goodbye properly to her big brother. Hopefully the way she's portrayed just means she's a really resilient kid. And she does acknowledge what's happening with Spider, in the middle of everyone else, you can make out her saying ""Don't..."" to her mother. It's not explored in the movies, but she is supposed to like Spider too, she's not as close to him as Kiri and Lo'ak because of the age difference, but she still likes him, and it did scare her to see her mother like that, but that's still mama, she still needs mama.",13,k3zbi8p,Avatar,t3_172vso6,t3_172vso6,1696768629.0

Hating Avatar makes you über progressive in those online slacktivists circles.

Also, they ignore that real life figures like [John Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_(abolitionist) did exist. Does that make him a ""white saviour"" too?

At what point does storytelling stop being ""problematic"" and start just being storytelling?

I often find progressive readings of art online (usually uppity terminally online tweeters or YTers) to be short-sighted and purely ideologically driven - as in these critics literally can't experience art outside of their strict moral and ideological lens.

And no, I'm not saying art isn't political or shouldn't be or anything stupid and regressive like that (hello I'm a huge Avatar fan...the biggest tree hugging movie ever) but looking at art for the sole purpose of debunking its""bad ideas"" is one miserable fucking way to engage in art. 

Maybe at some point you're just bringing your own baggage into something it has no business being in?

Art is under no obligation to make you feel validated in your worldview.

"Last Samurai gets this criticism (and yes it does have similarities to Avatar), too, but it's pretty stupid if anyone has actually seen the movies. Tom Cruise's character is a suicidal PTSD drunkard. He is saved by Samurai ultimately, but back to Avatar.

First off, it's simple, Eywa is a real thing, objectively true deity in Avatar. Jake is about to get shot in Avatar but Eywa makes a moral judgement of Jake's soul and provides a clear sign to Neytiri to not shoot him. Additionally, fast forward to the end and Jake is about to suffocate after Papa Dragon breaks into the research lab, however Neytiri pulls a legit gamer moves, deeply penetrates PD with some spear like arrows and brings Jake a mask. It's shown the Navi ways and perhaps some alien poon tang give meaning and purpose to Jake, who is a literally broken handicapped character.

Also in Last Samurai, Tom Cruise's character saves no one, they all get bested by modern weaponry.

Jake can't even feel a sense of true belonging with them, but he's desperately trying to find any meaning. I'm not too surprised he chose the Na'vi.

In this futuristic lost world that is Earth, the abuse and manipulation of nature has gone so far that an Avatar can be made, an organic robot that a consciousness can be uploaded into. Once you put your identity into a new body, the physical concept of 'Human' is irrelevant. So Jake found something worth fighting for that was not a lost cause.",11,izrbutp,Avatar,t3_zi6woq,t3_zi6woq,1670741342.0

"I think it’s important to first and foremost properly establish an agreed upon definition of what the “white savior"" trope is, and then from there to see if Avatar fits this definition. Very often we negate accusations of Avatar being a ""white savior"" story, because it can be a buzzword superficially tossed around in order to write off the film (which I think is absurd), but ALSO because we ourselves have an imprecise or vague definition in our minds of what the term actually means.

The definition I tend to go with is by authors Hernan Vera and Andrew M. Gordon who in relation to the trope have said, “This white savior is often portrayed as a man who is out of place within his own society, until he assumes the burden of racial leadership to rescue non-white minorities and foreigners from their suffering.” So far this sounds like a fair description of our hero Jake. They go on to say that, “As such, white savior stories have been described as ‘essentially grandiose, exhibitionistic, and narcissistic’ fantasies of psychological compensation.”

So altogether, according to this definition, they might suggest that Avatar is the story of Jake compensating for his own inadequacies within his race by excelling within another race and saving its people. So when the critics who understand the definition, use this term in relation to the film, I think they’re seeing a potential issue wherein Avatar centers and deals with Jake’s issues as a white/majority individual while “using” the Na’vi culture to get there. A “white savior” film is about insisting or assuming that you must tell the story of an incredible exotic place and people, THROUGH the perspective of a white man (or majority individual). The film’s lead exists as our normalized white vessel in order to humanize another culture, which doesn’t necessarily need a white man in order to be understood or cared about. Now, using whiteness as an entry point so you can explore another minority is undeniably effective for a lot of people, but it works off of some problematic assumptions of what’s actually “normal” vs. what’s “the other.” There’s also an important distinction between the choices a character makes themselves to classify as a ""white savior,"" and the choice of the filmmaker to use this trope in order to tell their story.

Also, Jake basically becomes an ancient civilization’s clan leader in a matter of months, which could be viewed as white people seeing the simplicity and ease with which to infiltrate another culture. Perhaps this is a tangential point, but I think it speaks to centering whiteness in narratives as the dominant default “normal” while using the “other” as a tool for self-exploration.

Now, if you disagree on the “white savior” definition I’ve used, then I would be interested in hearing which definition you’d be comfortable using so we can start from there and work forward again.

Additionally, despite Jake becoming one of the Na’vi in the end, it’s also a story about a white man who masquerades as a minority in order to use them for personal growth. Obviously this is a gross oversimplification, but this type of writing is seen as one of the primary faults of “white savior” narratives. Just because Jake becomes a blue alien, in the end it's still to the benefit of a white man. Jake’s perspective changing based on what he’s learned from the Na’vi, and therefore “saving him,” doesn’t negate this definition of a “white savior,” in fact it’s PART of the definition. First of all, Jake DOES literally save the Na’vi in the end, by uniting the tribes, and at the same time he’s also ""using"" the Na’vi for self-actualization. (I will note that the sequels will probably avoid this pitfall as Jake fully embodies his minority status in contrast to the returning human majority \[except perhaps the privilege of his former knowledge/perspective\].)

It’s also due to the sheer prevalence and repeated usage throughout the history of film (and other mediums) that “white savior” narratives are seen as problematic.

Ultimately, do I believe that Jake is the worst example of the “white savior” trope? Absolutely not, but at least according to the definition provided, he fits the description, so he’s on the spectrum.

Why do I NOT think he is the worst example? Because there are fair and valid things which complicate the reading, like that characters outside of Jake are given heroic moments of agency, which directly impact the plot, and the fact of Jake’s own intersectionality of his minority status as a paraplegic, as he's often “otherized” by fellow soldiers like Wainfleet.

Additionally, there are also a variety of things to obfuscate an obvious ""white savior"" reading of the film, such as the fact that throughout much of the movie our “white man” is blue. It’s also worth pointing out that we’ve been discussing more whether a film fits the definition and less why the utility of such labels matter and the effects of this kind of writing on audiences. I’ve highlighted a couple things I feel could be problematic about it, but alas I’m not a premiere scholar of social or film theory.

Avatar gives a vital platform to so many worthwhile causes like environmental responsibility and even racism itself (yes, a film can be ""white savior"" AND anti-racist in other ways), which pushes it beyond the realm of JUST or ONLY being a “white savior” trope that should be dismissed, and I consider them all with my continued enjoyment of the film. However, if we’re extracting out this one particular criticism for review, then based on the definition and evidence, “white savior” is technically a valid label.",10,izqwbh5,Avatar,t3_zi6woq,t3_zi6woq,1670732700.0

"I dont think this ""white savior"" notion, is really worth humoring at all. It's far too complex to properly assess any piece of storytelling with, other than the most blatant and tactless works.

The US is majority white, and the majority of working actors are white. So, naturally, most of these archetypal stories would feature mostly white actors in lead parts, even if society eliminated 100% of racism.

The formula behind these stories is that someone from one society finds themselves falling in love with another culture. They come to a realization that their society is fucked, and decide to assimilate with and help defend this other society from them.

They don't have to be white, but the odds are just higher that they will be in the US. In a Chinese version of a similar story, the actor is most likely to be Chinese. Same thing.",1,j5jcirg,Avatar,t3_zi6woq,t1_izqwbh5,1674477129.0

Like ""oh the movie has white savior tropes therefore its racist and you shouldn't watch it or like it"". Yea there's definitely reactionaries online who have made that claim but that doesnt have to be your takeaway. I think we need to be more willing to critique the films that we hold near and dear to us. Most white savior films are movies that are attempting to address things such as racism/colonialism.

Eywa knew that Jake was a good person and chose him because of that intrinsic potential, but that potential would still have been present in Jake with or without Eywa's selection, so the selection was more of a driving force to help facilitate, rather than the sole reason, for Jake's eventual about-face.",6,izpxrse,Avatar,t3_zi6woq,t1_izpx1h5,1670715340.0

"I’ve posted this on a few comments already but here is at least an alternate story I concocted.

You’d have a similar situation as we did with Jake. Quaritch is a war hero of the arachnid wars but is KIA. He however is resurrected into the RECOM program along with others who have distinguished themselves in the war.

They are sent to Pandora where the situation is fairly similar to the original film, only this time the RDA is more desperate to mine unobtainium. The Na’vi are unaware of the Arachnid threat and any attempts to communicate this to them is brushed off as Sky People lies.

The RECOMS are sent in to try an establish a dialogue as the science teams have been unsuccessful.

From here the plot can be more or less the same as the first film only with Quaritch. There is the added stake that Quaritch might be able to convince the Na’vi of the Arachnid threat by becoming one of them by learning their ways.

He earns their trust, but a desperate RDA accelerates their mining operations and plows the soul trees which in turn escalates tensions between the RDA and Na’vi.

Things then go from bad to worse as an Arachnid spore ship appears to be on a collision course with Pandora. The RDA goes on high alert and begins consolidating their forces in their fortresses. Estimates place the Arachnid landing zone by Hometree.

Quaritch is called back to base to join the defense but he is torn as he has come to appreciate the Na’vi way of life. He tries to convince them to leave hometree but like in the movie the tribe is convinced he is a traitor and is on the war path against the RDA. That is until the arachnids make planet fall and all hell breaks loose.

Quaritch gets separated from the Na’vi in the ensuing chaos. He manages to make contact with the other RECOMS and he finds out the RDA plans to let the Arachnids run rampant on the planet as they believe the local wildlife should be able to buy the RDA time to mine more unobtanium.

Sickened by this Quaritch rejoins the Na’vi after taming Toruk Makto. They then go on to uniting the tribes to fight the arachnids. The gathered tribes alert the Arachnids and they converge on the large number of Na’vi.

Meanwhile, the RECOMS organize an insurrection and a large portion of the security force (inspired by Quaritch as he is a war hero) organize an assault to aid the Na’vi. 

The battle for the Spirit Tree occurs with the Na’vi, RDA, and eventually Eywa battling the Arachnids and heavily damaging the swarm though many are still on the moon and retreat to regroup and grow their numbers.

Having shed their blood as brothers in arms, the RDA and Na’vi enter an alliance that is somewhat shaky still, but at least an understanding is achieved. Film would end on a high note but the threat is still out there.",1,jw3f680,Avatar,t3_15qi3j4,t3_15qi3j4,1691984451.0

Sickened by this Quaritch rejoins the Na’vi after taming Toruk Makto. They then go on to uniting the tribes to fight the arachnids. The gathered tribes alert the Arachnids and they converge on the large number of Na’vi.

Sure, the Na'vi would fight those things, but the humans as well, for having absolutely wrecked their planet for their own survival.

Na'vi skin contains a pigment called cyanin. It tans to a dark purple color. This is known for the Omatikaya but maybe not the Metkayina.

"I don't think they do, or if the changes are to be ovserved. Several reasons. Na'vi spend majority of their lives outside, in the sun. They wear very limited clothing, exposing most of their skin to the sun. Therefore, their skin is used to constanly experience sunlight. For Na'vi, it's not such an ocassional thing like it is for us humans, who only expose part of their bodies to the sun on a daily basis (lower arms, face etc.) and go sunbathe on a beach once a year in summer. Even if Na'vi do get tan, you wouldn't be able to tell a difference, as their exposure to the sun is rather constant and uniform among the people.

As for the skin color, the blue-ish is rather darker than lighter, meaning it's less prone to tanning (assuming their skin is of a similar biological structure to ours). Metkayina are lighter in color, but they are used to live in the water, so I'd guess their skin is of different properties. All in all I think Na'vi skin is different than ours in terms of biological processes.

There's also the matter of the radiation of Alpha Centauri, which is certainly different than that of our sun, though I can't tell if for better or worse. It could be stronger or weaker due to Pandora's atmosphere's properies, distance from the star, its size, etc.  

All in all, there are too many unknown factors to answer your question for sure, but from all my arguments I'd say that Na'vi constant exposure to the sun is enough to make the eventual tanning unobservable.",39,jyxjkr7,Avatar,t3_168t79c,t3_168t79c,1693738146.0

"I belive it works differently than what we understand as how human skin shade.
I don't understand how the art department designed it, but I have this theory that what actually makes the Na'vi skin change is more the substances to wich it is exposed to and the enviroments around it. Example: Omatikaya and other forest Na'vi is darker due to not so much sun exposure and to bend in with the night forest (and I think it happens the same with this clan in the Eastern Sea Coast cliffs, the one from the first movie, because I think they have a more land-centric live); Metkayina and other sea clans have lighter skin because it has more sun exposure and is in constant contact with salty water ( I hope the Pandoran sea works like human sea) and it is known that salt can make long-term corrosion in some fabrics and materials.
I belive that Na'vi skin and the skin of most animals in Pandora are leather-like and therefore, very tough and resistant and it's pigmentation changes with its surrounding chemicals and substances.",3,jz2yfuw,Avatar,t3_168t79c,t3_168t79c,1693827173.0

"People loved it the first time.  Part of the reason it made a quarter-billion in the US was positive word of mouth.

The only reason it seems like people didn’t like it is because of a joke meme.  And not even a good one.  The joke was stolen from an episode of South Park.

The internet is not reality.  An average joe on the street probably doesn’t know the plot of Avatar is similar to Ferngully (or whatever), They don’t know what a “White savior story” is, and they definitely don’t care.",22,i8irs0m,Avatar,t3_up5455,t3_up5455,1652488669.0
"THIS. If I may, and I apologize in advance if it’s too personal, I’d like to share my own story with Avatar all those years ago. Like many, I’m a child of divorce. In early 2009 I had recently moved out of my mother’s house because it had become an increasingly toxic environment, and I held onto the hope that moving in with my father and his new fiancé, would be a fresh start. It wasn’t. The refuge I sought became it’s own nightmare as feelings of welcome changed to outright rejection, and it was all too clear I wasn’t a person my father was willing to accept. My existence and who I loved was in his mind a betrayal. So all through the gaslighting and verbal abuse, I just kept my head down, burying myself in work and studies to get through. It was a time of survival. Yet, still, I blamed myself and questioned my apparent inability to live happily with either parent, and that maybe the problem for being unable to find stability was me. Well, at around this time, the rumor mill was in full swing on what James Cameron’s newest venture would be after 12 years.

Before my mother’s house, I had been raised by my Grandmother (I call her “Nanny”), an incredibly caring woman, who was as lovable as she was unorthodox, and as such, we’d gleefully watch Aliens and Terminator on television together. Cut to several years later, and Titanic would find me bawling my eyes out in public, then immediately becoming my favorite film. So from the time Avatar was announced to when I was sitting in that theater seat, I was beyond ecstatic! Here was finally something to hold onto, something that could cut through all the negative noise of my life, and remind me of those times just hanging out with Nanny on the couch watching blockbusters.

I’ve been living on my own for about 8 years now. I’ve worked my way through school and multiple jobs and now I have a career. And when December 16th finally rolls around, you better believe I’m going to be one of the first in line, and standing right by my side will be my 80 year-old grandmother, my Nanny, just as jittery and gleeful as I am! This is our film as much as it’s everyone else’s. This isn’t some generic tale about surviving oppression, this is my story, your story, an escape from hardship and an example of persevering against it, for anyone who was ever told they weren’t good enough, told they were betraying what someone wanted them to be, and for those who never thought they’d survive in the face of violent opposition.

It’s not within me to deny a film’s faults, no film is perfect, but let me tell you, that a sci-fi movie with blue aliens spoke to me in a way that few real people had, in a way that told me I was valid, and told me I was seen.",5,i8jzm3x,Avatar,t3_up5455,t3_up5455,1652515872.0

"Exactly this. Plus, I feel like the only way a white savior trope is offensive if they make it a point to say a white dude saved the day and the non-whites were too dumb, incompetent, or generally senseless to save themselves, and this incredibly offensive idea simply doesn't exist in Avatar. Jake is some disabled guy that gets a second chance after his world came crashing down around him because his brother died and he's missing a sense of family in his life. Jake's character isn't ""not charming"" because the actor sucks, he's odd and disenchanted because his bro is dead and he's having a surreal experience on a planet where the appearance of a new alien nature is distracting him from a few bad situations.  


The best part yet that these ""white savior"" people like to forget is that he was originally not a ""white savior"" but was 100% there to destroy the natives' way of life because his boss ordered him too. There was little good intention in him until he got closer to the people and slowly took on their way of life as his own. There is no white savior here, it's a damaged guy finding a new culture and way of life, and going so far as to fight for it, and he wasn't the only good fighter either, every na'vi there was going ham on the human forces.  


This white savior claim has zero reason to exist for Avatar, and the people who fling this concept around are being intellectually dishonest for the express purpose of finding people to gatekeep, gaslight, and bully.",1,i8mnhp6,Avatar,t3_up5455,t1_i8kned3,1652567813.0

"“… light beer and blue jeans? There is nothing that we have that they want.”

The Na’vi are perfectly content with the life they live. Metkayina live in harmony with the oceans and the Omaticaya are one with the forests. Granted, there is no literary evidence of any Na’vi clan dissatisfied with Pandora but this is their way. This is what makes them happy (I mean, you get to fly a winged beast as part of your coming-of-age. Who wouldn’t want that?)

The Na’vi, at the end of the day, should’ve been left alone and never to be bothered. 

People try to justify the expansion of humanity into Pandora as a move to save the human race. But the thing is that eventually, with the same habits that led to the destruction of planet Earth, the same will happen to Pandora. This will carry on until Eywa is dead and Pandora is a husk of a planet with zero greenery and smoke belched skies and the RDA will decide “yeah, let’s find a new planet to pillage”.

In the end, even though we can, we probably shouldn’t. If you’re gonna call me the type of person that would resign humanity to doom that WE caused, I just think that there are other alternatives (like, idk, saving the planet we already have?)",37,k7hscaf,Avatar,t3_17lo0vv,t3_17lo0vv,1698925214.0

"With literally sticking to the laws of Eywah and preventing themselves from any kind of development (note: not human-influenced but their own path to a higher existence), Na’vi has made themselves extremely vulnerable to any advanced form of life. Assuming that there are multiple alien civilisations in the Avatar universe, it was only a matter of time before another life-form would notice the abundance of Pandora and came in hot to colonise or strip bare. Life is very violent and has its own set of even more violent rules: if you can’t adapt, you go extinct. Simple. And looking at the way of life they stick to so adamantly, they pretty much heading towards extinction. I agree with the notion that we can’t force them to advance or change the way we want them. It’s something they will have to do themselves. They will have to reform their way of life in order to make themselves a formidable force and it is something that can be done without technically breaking the laws. Their cognitive abilities and connection to the planet would enable them to step up to the next step in the evolutionary ladder without technological advancement. It would only take one Na’vi with a wanting to understand more about their connection and what could they collectively do with it apart from remembering.",4,k7hc3wx,Avatar,t3_17lo0vv,t3_17lo0vv,1698913219.0
"Why did we stop being hunter-gatherers? **Climate change**. 

Believe it or not, it was natural climate change which pushed the tribesmen to develop horticulture and herding. In fact, the first civilizations (namely Egypt, Babylon, Hindus-valley) started over at places where the weather started changing drastically and desertification became visible. It also happened over in America, with the Mayans and the Quechua (Inca) for the same reason: drought and heat mounted up, and there weren't enough game to sustain the people by hunting/gathering. 

This natural climate change is the result of the 20.000-year Glaciation cycle: the Earth goes frozen cold half of it and then it gets warmer and warmer, until it freezes again.  

There is also evidence that over-hunting by humans was the cause of extinction of the megafauna (woolly mammoth, etc.) all over the world. As a species, we never developed a balance with our natural environment. Perhaps now, we may be able to develop a conscious and intelligent relationship with Nature, again, because of human-induced climate change. We might end up back in a Cretaceous hot-house, with pine forest in Antarctica and rainforests all over Europe. And dinosaurs.",7,k7ifj4g,Avatar,t3_17lo0vv,t3_17lo0vv,1698935674.0

"I feel like you are skipping out and outright just claiming facts are wrong.

The RDA is infact singularly focused on prolonging the human species, the issue is that the RDA is still a capitalism-focused corporation, so even with military oversight, rich folks can buy their way to the colony.

You seem to be conflating civilized and primitive. Yes the NaVi are very civilized like modern humans. But they are infact primitive. Primitive doesn’t necessarily mean “stupid  backwards savages”. They are primitive. They have no modern amenities that make life easier.

Most cultures/continents invented farming long before colonialism was ever invented. Way way way before-. Not to mention, even if we don’t know we the farmers decided to start farming, we know that the benefits of farming outweighed most from hunting/gathering.



Do not ignore the Laws of Eywa, even if everyone doesn’t know, the plausibility of this theory and adjacent thoughts is incredibly important! It makes the rest of your points wrong. They developed enough to make the laws before and they clearly need it now.

"I get where you’re coming from but I also have to disagree somewhat. I won’t go into the “civilized” aspect because that’s really hard to quantify, how do you determine what a more, or less, civilized society is? What’s the reference point, you know? So I’ll concede that point. But the whole “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” That I have to disagree. 

The most basic law of nature is that the strong survive. A specie’s existence is simply that, a fight for survival in which they either adapt or die, no third option. A species cannot stay stagnant in complacency because if so, a time will come when they *will* be wiped off, change is inevitable. This is as true in Earth as it is in Pandora. Even the Na’vi aren’t exempt from that simple law since they had to develop more advanced techniques to survive other than just “existing,” like inventing the bow and arrow, knives, strength in numbers, fire, etc. 

Now, us, humans, turned to farming because it gave us a more stable, long term food supply and therefore security than having to depend on specific migration patterns for animals and having to compete for sustainability (again, adapt or die). This allowed us to develop bigger and better clans that evolved to villages, then to societies, to kingdoms, to empires. But, at its core, all that was still simply a  “survival of the fittest” type of deal, which in turn forced us to create better technologies, which… Well you know how that goes. 

So, in Avatar, just like what happened with the colonization of the Americas, the technologically advanced foreigners’ arrival simply expedited what was going to definitely happen eventually: The Na’vi will need to either evolve or go extinct. James Cameron has said we’ll see “bad” Na’vi next, meaning they’re not all kind and peaceful. So, assuming humans never arrived, I guarantee the Fire (bad) Na’vi would eventually become the Aztec empire of Pandora; that is subjugating neighboring tribes through violence, forcing these others to fight back or be wiped off, leading to arms races, and it would be a repeat of human history. *It’s inevitable.* In nature, stagnation is death, change is the only constant. So in a way that’s kind of one of the (many) reasons I’m pro-human, I just don’t see the Na’vi having that will to survive. They don’t have goals, drives, anything really pushing them forward other than just… “Merely surviving,” and that’s just a delayed form of extinction.",-1,k7ha9sk,Avatar,t3_17lo0vv,t3_17lo0vv,1698911616.0

"Yes, you make a good point. This is a debate that is already in motion, in the comics at least, which cover the stuff the movies struggle to have time for. Jake makes the argument that the Na'vi must learn to work with human weapons and tech in order to stand a fighting chance, at least until the enemy is beaten for good. This doesn't mean getting rid of their identity and core values, merely adapting, at least temporarily. Some Na'vi, namely Tsu'tey and Mo'at among the named characters, see the prudence in this, and although they still perform rituals to cleanse their being from the corruption they believe can come from their use, they still do use them. Then you have characters like Neytiri, who adamantly resist change. She claims there is no need for it because she's perfectly capable of taking down gunships with her bow and arrows - except she is one of the best archers alive on Pandora and one of only two characters seen to be able to pull it off - what is everyone else supposed to do, die?

For words like “civilized” and “primitive” I’m more so talking about how people are using them in the posts I’ve been seeing. Yes, they are primitive in the sense that they are living in ways that we lived thousands of years ago. However, when people use that word in certain contexts they do mean “lesser.” As for the word civilized…there’s a whole history about people referring to Indigenous societies as less civilized, and I think that issue is self explanatory. Unfortunately I’ve been seeing people use it in such a way to refer to the Na’vi.

I think you misunderstood my point about farming. I bring up farming because that’s when societies stop becoming hunter-gatherers.

Culture is an adaptation. 

Think of how many animals have very similar biology to to their Pre-Mesozoic ancestors. They didn’t need to change much physically because their adaptation served them well.

It’s the same thing with culture. Even with the creation of farming, it wasn’t needed by all societies.

Also, the fact that you’re saying you’re “pro human” shows you missed the point of the movies.

"I would like to have a strategic game similar to Halo Wars.

RDA vs Na'vi but well balanced like a bit scissors, stone and paper mechanic.

Aircraft/Ikran -> Infantery -> Cavallery/Land Vehicle -> Aircraft/Ikran -> and further...

Bases would be RDA bases with upgradable defense towers and buildings.

Hometree would be similar but have Ikran-patrols to be their defense towers.

RDA and Na'vi would have some kind of leaders with their own abilities to use to create stats boost or moving troops faster between bases and outposts and would have their own titan-unit like Dragon-Gunship or Toruk Makto for example.

Also Resistance could be a thing which is mixed RDA vehicles and Na'vi.

Im one who like to play as both Na'vi and RDA just to see both sides. 

A remake of the Avatar 2009 PC game and the DS game would be great and be retconned to canonize them for the movies.

The Avatar 2009 game had the dicision between RDA and Na'vi + you could stay as human and use vehicles against the RDA. Shooting down RDA AMPs while sitting in an AMP is fun.

"I don't think it'll be ""the next *Star Wars*"" in the way you're implying. For starters, part of *Star Wars*' mystique is simply how *unexpected* a success it was. George Lucas was a relative outsider in Hollywood, with his only directing credits being *THX-1138* (an experimental sci-fi film) and *American Graffiti* (a teen coming-of-age film). The cast was almost entirely freshman actors with a couple veteran British character actors. It was turned down by three different studios before getting funding from Fox, and even then had to stick to the rather paltry budget of $8 million. The production was beset with delays, ran over budget, and its release had to be pushed back five months. Fox was so nervous that it would fail that they only opened it in 38 theaters. It was literally an overnight success, simultaneously defining a whole new genre of science fiction (nowadays dubbed the 'space opera'), and becoming one of the first true Hollywood blockbusters. In six months it was the highest-grossing film of all time, to the surprise of all involved, especially Lucas—he had fully anticipated the film to flop.
pro
*Avatar*, on the other hand, was borne from completely different circumstances. James Cameron was a veteran director with over 25 years of experience whose movies had collectively grossed over 3 billion dollars. His last film, *Titanic*, had won 11 Oscars and was the highest grossing film of all time. From the beginning, he touted it as a visual and technical spectacle, and had little problem securing the $237 million budget for it. Before its release, there was a sizable contingent of box office analysts figuring it would be a massive hit, if not *the* massive hit. It opened to 14,000 screens nationwide, and grossed $1 billion in under 3 weeks. In 41 days, it became the highest grossing film of all time, breaking Cameron's own record.

Ultimately, I don't think *Avatar* will redefine the entire genre of sci-fi the way *Star Wars* did—the genre is too massive and well-established for that to happen now. But beyond its many technical accolades, what I think *Avatar* will be remembered for is the fact that James Cameron intends for it to be his magnum opus. It's something that's literally been decades in the making, and he sat on it until he managed to secure the political, financial, and technical capital to pull it off. Because of that he's dodging the pitfalls that sank so many other directors' dream projects, like budgetary constraints and studio interference. Kubrick couldn't get *Napoleon* made, but Cameron did it twice and is on track to do it three more times.

To summarize the difference, *Star Wars* is like, well, *Star Wars*: one guy in a crappy little shoestring vehicle who manages to blow up the whole system. *Avatar* is like building the Titanic, but this time he's actually navigating it successfully to New York.",8,j27h0x5,Avatar,t3_zyhm4k,t3_zyhm4k,1672375827.0

It's also possible the tulkun are suffering their own political crisis over the hunting and are divided on what to do.

What I got from that was that the Tulkun wars Tonawari speaks of must have been so brutal that they instinctively became pacifists. It took Payakan bonding with Lo'ak who himself is an outsider (and a non Metkayina Na'vi/Avatar hybrid at that) to fight against the humans again after being an outcast. I believe that in future movies more Tulkun will rise up. I also think it's fascinating that the same defense mode Eywa put the forest creatures on hadn't reached the sea creatures.,10,j8njspk,Avatar,t3_112zt4t,t3_112zt4t,1676480145.0
"It might make more sense if you look at how whales function in real life. I think the tulkun way is based off on that. Whales are gentle giants for a reason, they dont kill other animals, but would rather protect them from harm instead. This is called alturism and alot of evidence for this behaviour exist in ex. Humpback whales (115 cases recorded). Also the discovery of spindle cells in the brains of some whale and dolphin species provides good supporting evidence that they are capable of experiencing complex emotions such as empathy, maybe even more than we do. Orcas even posess an area of the brain that humans dont, (the insular cortex) an extension of the emotional brain that is believed to guide them to act in the interests of the group rather than just themselves.

With this said, the tulkun likely dont want to kill or harm humans, thinking more about the safety of their own group. So when it comes to a fight, they would rather give way to the will of humans instead of their own. (also alturism) 
The opposite is basically what Payakan did.

And the fact thay Payakan's pod just threw him out to fend for himself while he was probably a kid/teen in Tulkun years after his revenge plot. I know they're aliens but it still felt cruel somehow? You know have a traumatized child/teen that's been abadoned, has to fend for himself and other Tulkun (maybe Navi too) are telling others not to have anything to do with him because of the revenge plot. That just sounds...evil? Maybe I am overthinking?",7,j8nklov,Avatar,t3_112zt4t,t3_112zt4t,1676480461.0
"I think their pacifism is a deeply held ideology that essentially saved them from really horrible period for a long time, therefore it seems integral to their cohesion as a community and social bond. The threat from the humans is relatively new and im sure they struggle with it, it wouldn't be easy to just switch and abandon an ideology that held them together for so long. In that, they are very sympathetic, we see human cultures that struggle with their core ideals in the face of new developments or threats and it takes a while to change and accept a new reality and new way of being, it's a delicate process and  could risk tear the community apart.  
  
but luckily I don't think Cameron and the other co writers are just leaving it at that, as we see that Payakan's defiance of that pacifism is what saved the day, so sooner or later they're gonna have to confront that fact and deal with it, and what comes out of that will be really interesting.",4,j8ni0am,Avatar,t3_112zt4t,t3_112zt4t,1676479443.0

It might be fucked up but think about it this way: by following this extreme form or pacifism it seems that they've effectively stopped any and all conflict amongst themselves that used to plague them for a long time.

"No, I don't. You kind of have to look at things within a sandbox taking different matters into consideration. 

They're highly intelligent. From an evolutionary point of view, you could say they'd have different paths of developing. One path would involve competing for resources, the other path would be finding a way to live in harmony. 

Their no kill policy worked for the community they existed in. It needed to develop in that manner so that they would never resort to it. 

Whilst they lived in harmony, it wasn't an issue. Now things have changed. They're dealing with a threat outside of their eco system so they will have to adapt.",2,j8p2ct7,Avatar,t3_112zt4t,t3_112zt4t,1676501156.0
"They said the tulkun are much smarter than 2150s humans who have advanced crab robots and stuff, maybe tulkuns have a whole government and politics and laws that they follow that doesn’t make sense to us.

"The tulkun aren't thinking like you are, like ""oh we have to defend the helpless and weak among us.""

We don't know anything about their mourning and burial rituals right now, so we definitely can't say that they're like ""oh well, they drew the short straw.""

The point of pacifism is that violence only results in more violence and the only way to end violence is by breaking the chain of violence. This is explicitly shown to be true in the plot of the movies. Payakun gets mad because his mom is murdered so he gets a bunch of other tulkun together to fight back, and the result is that everyone but him dies and he nearly dies too. Jake and the Omatikaya fought back and they chased away the humans in the first movie, but they came back with way more people and weapons.

"I kinda agree with you. It's hard for me to sympathize with Tulkuns even if their worldview is based in the 'deper understanding' of things or whatever.

But this is why I sympathize with Payakan a lot. He wanted to change things. His act was irresponsible but he was young and his society would never help him with his grief. He got cruelly persecuted for it. Tulkun society seems to have a 'holier than tou' mentality yet are willing to let a mother and child die an awful death and abandon one of their own kind when they don't think the same way as them.",1,j8rm15v,Avatar,t3_112zt4t,t3_112zt4t,1676554635.0
"I think the Tulkun's apathy to the entire situation is merely a device to echo the overall theme of the movie: in the long-run, your pod/family/whatever is only as safe as the environment you're in.

"They're aware that if they fought back they (and/or the humans) would be slaughtered indiscriminately. And their pacifism, in a nutshell, is largely based around the idea that any conflict, no matter how justified, will escalate. They are technically right about that (see how the attempt by w/ the pod that Payakan was part of led *directly* to the extermination of the entire group) – but obviously doesn't work when the entire species is suddenly being systematically hunted by a new apex predator.

In short though, the Tulkun's pacifism is a moral / code that they've maintained for millenia, for good (so far) reasons, and that works provided that they and the Na'vi are the apex intelligent predators in their ecosystem, and abide by the same exact shared code of ethics, and traditionalism.

It obviously isn't working well *now,* but traditionalist cultures can take a *very* long time (and/or severely traumatic incident) to change, even if *not* changing / adapting is obviously (and in this case severely) to their detriment.

The Na'vi and Tulkun are both *very* deeply traditionalist cultures though, and are *intended* to be hard to change (and this is accomplished / enforced by social shunning, a la native american and various other traditionalist cultures), *on purpose*.

The Na'vi themselves have their own laws that basically, *intentionally* prohibit them from developing complex industrial technology, for instance, and it would / will be *very* hard to get them to change that.",1,j8qpb0x,Avatar,t3_112zt4t,t1_j8nnc3v,1676530607.0

"A few exceptions aside, CGI in film peaked around 2013. And by CGI I mean complex stuff like fully CG characters and complex action/environments. CGI is used in ways many people don't notice. 

But as far as ""CGI as a tool for spectacle"" then nothing touches either Avatar film. The only films that on the same playing field are the the Planet of the Apes trilogy - mainly the 2 sequels. 

I also think the Sequel Trilogy has incredible CGI. 

Seeing the Ant-Man trailer play before TWOW deadass feels like a joke. 

I'm not saying every blockbuster needs to meet the heights of Avatar, but boy has it gone downhill in the past decade. 

The Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy looks better today than anything the MCU has out in a decade. Hell, MCU films a few years apart show a night and day difference.

"The last two times I saw it was in Dolby Laser 4K 3D and the entire time I’m watching it I’m thinking about how I understand on an intellectual level how this was made, I’ve watched all the BTS footage I could find but it still seemed more plausible to me that Cameron flew out to Alpha Centauri then filmed aliens there. 3 hours of runtime and 99 percent of the time my brain completely accepted that was I was seeing is real. 

I still consider Avatar to have the best CGI of any film not named “Way of Water”, and that’s just the “base” version of it, not the 4k HFR re-release. Maybe certain films like Gravity, Dune, BR 2049, or the Planet of the Ape films can match or exceed the photo realism in certain scenes – but none have anywhere near the scope and scale of CGI VFX than Avatar.

"Visual Effects artist here. To a degree it has become commoditized. When you think about 10 years ago there was 1 streaming service which was not creating its own content, 5 broadcast networks which had a very low bar for CGI content, and then the film studios.

Just 10 years later we have a number of large streaming platforms all making unique content, this content is expected to be film quality, and the actual films we work on have way more CGI content … we are talking thousands of shots per film. The visual effects pipeline is so stable that it’s easier to lean on and offers more control, so they do. But the sheer amount of work there is to do is why it has peaked. My particular studio has sites all over the world with thousands of artists and we are still chronically behind.

Avatar was different. I had a lot of friends who worked on it and it just had different expectations and a different timeline - it was given the time to be good. I had a friend who worked on it from 2014 to 2022 … most films I work on are 6-12 month projects, I can’t imagine how much quality we could pack into a film with 8 years to work on it.

"Yeah, actually, that might be also part of the reason it was cut, it makes Quaritch's following dialogue a little weird, like the two wouldn't mesh very well one after the other.

"No.
The movie scene went roughly as follows-
Quaritch takes Kiri hostage-
Spider pleads for Quaritch to let Kiri go-
Neytiri hops up and grabs Spider-
Ney demands release of Kiri-
Quaritch denies but is nervous-
Ney prepares to Stab Spider-
Quaritch releases Kiri with a shove-
Ney angrily whips Spider behind her-
Sullys and Spider Back into the water-
-

The cut scene is specifically different because Neytiri keeps ahold of Spider after Quaritch releases Kiri, bringing the knife to Spiders neck- which encourages Quaritch to try redirect her “Your going to kill the boy?” And “Your war is with me!”,, where then Jake calms Neytiri down and takes the Knife from Neytiri.

Not to mention, in the cut scene, Neytiri also hisses at Kiri when Kiri begs her to let Spider go.",2,kd9xvag,Avatar,t3_18hfg1i,t1_kd9ornk,1702525161.0

"This is an interesting question and one that a lot of fans have wondered about.

The Activist Survival Guide strongly suggests that there is what amounts to an anti-RDA ""Resistance"" back on Earth.

Now whether there is or not is up to James Cameron, of course, but I don't think he'll end the series on a downer note.

I think the overarching structure of the series is this: A1 was the ""Prologue"" to the series, A2, A3, and A4 are the trilogy at the core of the series, and A5 is the ""Epilogue"" to the whole thing.

I very strongly suspect the RDA has thrown its bolt with the invasion in TWOW and they cannot sustain a long, involved war with the Na'vi, in my opinion.

Now, the question of what is going on back on Earth and how many people are aware of what is really happening on Pandora is an open question, of course.  Quite a few fanfic writers tried to address this question, with varying degrees of success.  This question is central to my fan novel.  I (kind of, sort of) suspect James Cameron intends to have a hopeful ending to the series that will give people some sense of hope about the future.

The central lesson of the whole series is this: Pandora is not out there, light years in space and the Na'vi are not way off out there on a moon orbiting a planet around Alpha Centauri A,.

Pandora is right here, under our feet and the Na'vi are right here.  They are us and we are them.

" 

Neteyam's character is actually quite important. His death causes an even bigger motive for the family to go after quaritch. His death marked and scarred the family for life and i believe Loak is going to be super revengeful and showcase great dynamic in the future movies.

However I believe there is a major plot hole here that it needs to be covered in the next films. Kiri had a seizure underwater that one time we saw that she connected to the ancestors tree and saw Grace. And then the scientists told jake that if she connects again it could kill her. But given the fact that she still processes her supernatural powers maybe she will sacrifice herself and connect again to revive Neteyam somehow.

Otherwise why would Cameron add this to the story ? Her seizure and the fact that she could die if she does it again. For me it shows that she will definitely connect again and something will happen that will cause eventually kiri to contribute a huge change to the movies later on.

Or maybe nothing happens and we will just see the children grow and neteyam to only be in memories. But as there are plot holes in avatar 2 that need further explanation in the next ones I believe we are not done with Neteyam yet. And Cameron wouldn't say much more for neteyam or the rest of the cast because he needs to keep the viewers anticipating and at the edge of their seat for unexpected things that will definitely happen in the next films. Like in avatar 2 before the first spoilers came out I personally never expected to see Quaritch alive again.

So my opinion is that we will be surprised with neteyam , loak will take on the role as the bigger brother now and more mature , kiri will add a major change to the story and spider could turn villainous since neytiri will definitely be hostile towards him and don't forget that he saved his father showcasing that he started to understand somehow that their bond blossomed into a father and a son relationship.",1,jeoczma,Avatar,t3_10a6wf1,t3_10a6wf1,1680453018.0

"This is just my theory pasted that's on my profile:

Neteyam can be brought back to life the same way Quaritch was revived: by transferring his human consciousness to his new avatar body. However,  since Neteyam does not have a human body, they can sample his DNA (from his corpse) and make a  cloned version of him in the laboratory, after the clone has fully developed they can transfer his consciousness to his cloned version of himself just like they did with Quaritch. Either Kiri or Max or any of the other scientists can do this. I'm not sure about the technology of how they actually managed to transfer Quaritch's consciousness because it was not descriptively shown. I read in an article that his memories and  DNA were transferred in a tube while he was still alive, so I'm not sure how it would work with someone that's already dead. That's where I  think Kiri steps in with her Eywa abilities to somehow transfer his consciousness by the Tree of Souls since that's where his memories are captured and she could connect him somehow.

But,  yeah that's just my theory that I wanted to share with some Neteyam enthusiasts since I'm a  huge one haha. I think it's very possible to happen if Cameron is open to bringing him back unless he's set on his decision on keeping him dead. I really hope he reconsiders after seeing the massive influx of  Neteyam fans.

I think all the hype neteyam received is bc of the actor looks not bc of the character itself.

I believe that Neteyam will return, maybe even in all sequels, but as a spirit inside Eywa. We will see.

I remember that once I thought that Kiri and the Sullys would have great troubles, and Kiri would sacrifice himself by giving himself to Eywa to bring Neteyam and he could help his family, I even imagined that Neteyam would go after some Toruk once he was resurrected haha. So there would be a balance in life, he reuniting with the Sullys and Kiri with his mom Grace.

"You are welcome.  In the Avatar 2 Visual dictionary, these kinds of devices similar to an SSD (but super modern) keep Quaritch's memories.  Regarding Neteyam, I like your theory, but every theory falls a bit if we think about the weight his death had in A2, if he revives, it would have to be for an incredibly good and well done reason, otherwise it would make the emotional ending of A2 meaningless. And it would seem that the deaths in the franchise will be worth little, because sooner or later everyone can be revived

"To me, I feel like we've had enough deaths as it is. So, even if Cameron brought back Neteyam I don't think it correlates with ""all death being meaningless in Avatar"", since we had so many characters that died. I think Cameron already lowered the meaning of death by bringing back Quaritch and saving him numerous times. Although I don't mind resurrection in a movie like Avatar, because to me it makes sense since it's a sci-fi movie. Even in an interview where Cameron was asked about bringing Quaritch back he said something along the lines ""In the world of sci-fi if you have any spec of DNA you can bring everybody back"". And, no I definitely do not think Cameron would have to bring back every single character that died sooner or later.  To me Neteyam's resurrection would make a lot of sense to me, his funeral felt unfinished to me, like he's gonna come back or something. I mean his name translates to ""not the end"". I'll just end with I don't think bringing back Neteyam will lower his impact from Avatar 2 I think that it will bring even more emotion knowing that he got his redemption arc.",1,jo9mwty,Avatar,t3_10a6wf1,t1_jo94nsj,1686860396.0

"There is no doubt that he was an excellent character.  It's all secrecy with this franchise and we'll hardly know until we see A3, or maybe we will need to see A4 to find out.  As I told you, they could justify his death, there are many ways to revive him, I don't think it was through DNA since it doesn't seem like they ever took a sample from him, but through Eywa or Kiri.  

But I don't know, nobody knows, his destiny is a limbo, I believe more in his return as a spirit, as Neytiri's sister did in the comics, because what we do know is that the actor filmed scenes for A3, but it is quite possible that for A4 he has no longer participated.

But assuming they are correct, we know that 2 and 3 are basically one giant movie split in two, which means that characters will not be forgotten just because they died. James introduced the communication through the spirit tree because it will most likely be a very important element in 3.
Neteyam will come back as a soul or as a memory (it's Jake's son, he will not just stop remembering him), but not back to life.

I think being able to breathe Pandora’s air is okay but I’d prefer if he didn’t because him being not of Pandora is integral to why he doesn’t belong to either world. He’s the perfect mediator between the two species,3,jmkw4t2,Avatar,t3_13xnekc,t3_13xnekc,1685685353.0
"From what I read from the leaked script and image, Kiri and maybe Eywa did something to him to make him able to breathe the air and grow his own queue to save his life. Spider can very well be the first human-Navi hybrid and possibly humanity's future.",6,jmiql3f,Avatar,t3_13xnekc,t3_13xnekc,1685649223.0
"I am OK with the idea as long as it is part of Eywa's plans to end the conflict. Because honestly, the only way this is going to end in peace is by both sides to have an agreement, and for that Eywa needs a face to speak to the humans, something that serves as an avatar for the deity herself and IMO that's where Kiri and Spider and heading to.",3,jmkeeak,Avatar,t3_13xnekc,t3_13xnekc,1685674790.0
"He will further grow attached to Quarich because that's James Cameron.

Or he could help show Quarich the good side of Pandora.",2,jmji3cn,Avatar,t3_13xnekc,t3_13xnekc,1685660173.0
"I think he may gin adaptations in A3 but I do think he will need his own avatar. As good as adaptations may be, him being in a human body will still hinder him from being able to full integrate into Na'vi society. Even Jake and the others have problems because of their human features, but he is a whole human. And Chosen by Eywa doesn't mean discrimination is muted, as we clearly see in The Next Shadow comic and ATWOW.",2,jmjvhc0,Avatar,t3_13xnekc,t3_13xnekc,1685666046.0

"I'm personally againts the idea of Spider getting an Avatar, so i'm completely okay with anything as long as he stay in his human body. I like the idea of him being capable to breath Pandora air, and tho i'm highly skeptical about the neural queue thing, I will believe it as long as they give us a scientifical explanation. 
I could be wrong about this, but I feel that a big part of Spider characther arc will be about him accepting his humanity. Therefore is possible that he will act as a mediator between humans and Na'vis, and show that coexisting between them it's possible. I mean, the fact that the characther he's the closest to has a deep connection to Eywa is extremely telling.

"I agree, while I would love it regardless, I think it’s new and different and fits his character more to be the one to evolve. Jake, for the most part, I’d still heavily connected to his humanity. While he’s pretty much assimilated there are some things he’s just never going to adjust to fully on Pandora. He also has the background of having lived his entire childhood on Earth he has more of a connection to them that way. Spider, however, he’s grown up- yes, with human scientists, but spent more time around the Na’vi.

"Original comment text before revision:

u/WaterNa-vi I am happy for our interests to remain separate. Clean break.

All the best with r/Avatar.

I know this comment will be deleted swiftly (then again, you may choose to leave it here, in the interest of both sides of the story being shared, we'll see. You might just want your narrative to tinge all of this),

and this ancillary account banned as well.

but just so you know, this post is the **third** in a trilogy of disproportionate decisions on your / your team's part:

1. removing u/AlbertChessaOfficial and u/AvatarPodcast accounts as mods (on the day of ATWOW's trailer, which stung), with **no** prior 1:1 dialogue or warning for, 'wrongdoing'. And what was this wrongdoing, you may ask? posting on this sub, same as anyone else. I've even had friends describe this place as 'my baby' which is kind of them. But -- I won't accept that term towards my actions. There was never any intent to misinform or abuse the mod role, only to hype and have fun. I had to message Olly to remove Kelutreddit's icon too, such was the extremity of the sea-change. I only backed down for a time so that ATWOW's trailer hype wouldn't be spoiled. But I never forgot this bizzare and hurtful choice from your team, nor how my initially measured and polite requests to be reinstated were progressively more aggressively shot down, leading me to become harder-of-heart in turn towards you, and this whole issue. You guys took it into this serious, exclusionary direction. No light-hearted chime-ins about what you'd prefer I do instead. No grounding/levelling with each other. No humanity. Just over-authoritative reactionary responses instead of dialogue opening. Like I said, fundamentally different vibes.
2. **Banning** those accounts from the sub after you reached out recently about why people in my circle had been (understandably) expressing negativity towards Kelutreddit, and reducing my capacity to speak my side of events. This recent correspondence contained lots of speaking frankly, and an outline of how I'd be willing to re-enter good relations. All that was ignored in favour of pursuing these 'he-said'she-said' concerns, after which you went dead quiet and silently banned me. Oh well.
3. as mentioned, this very post.

Things are very, very different here than when I created the community icons and banners, the flairs you all still use, when I cared for and was a custodian of this place.

End of an era.

You can write and pin as many sensationalising posts like this about the situation as you like,

But the truth of what you did will just sit there, being unassailably what it is.

I wish you well in whatever you're building here.

Let's do our different things and not get in each other's ways again.

"Well it’s the same thing. It’s been well studied for years that skin tones are a genetic evolution of geographical locations. Nature has selected for people with darker skin in tropical latitudes, especially in nonforested regions, where ultraviolet radiation from the sun is usually the most intense.  Melanin acts as a protective biological shield against ultraviolet radiation.  You can see this evolution from The Omaticaya people and Metkayina people. So similar to their skin tone being lighter in shade other parts of their bodies will adapt to their surrounding. The only comparisons I can give so it’s understandable is why we have melanin. 

Fins for example, why do some creatures on Earth have fins? For example, ducks, why do they have webbed feet and feathers? Chickens don’t have webbed feet. So ducks have webbed feet due to structural adaption. They use them to obtain food.",1,j2kib65,Avatar,t3_zzh7rt,t1_j2i5sfw,1672619174.0

"I agree with all of this too.  While I get some of the criticisms that this film used the bones of the first film and just re did it with different characters.  I really didn't mind that, what stood out to me was just how much more nuanced the characters were. Even Quaritch, it kinda has me stunned, how they took what was essentially a one note character and made him really interesting.

I heard some criticisms that it was like ""Quaritch is back, boo!. He was the same"". But he wasn't. All the things you mentioned, that's why I'm really interested to see where he will go. Cause he is essentially just a clone of Quaritch. Holding on to Quaritch's ideals and eventually letting them go is just a really cool arc to me.

"See that's why it's fascinating to me.  His motivation is pride. But that's because the basis of his personality is a construct of Quaritch. His behaviour and his attitude of trying to be and act exactly like the person he is cloned after means that at some point, he is going to question and that the basis of his personality will start to fall apart.

The original Quaritch was highly prejudiced. Had outdated beliefs and hated the navi. Now this clone of him is carrying his mission. What becomes of him if for example he does wipe out the Navi?. The government will likely kill him too, and him being essentially Navi, puts his personality at odds with his personality construct.  It's no longer ""back water man against Navi"".

It reminded me of my own two brother's wives because they can't stand eachother. I laughed OUT LOUD at that, but I thought I was the only one who saw it. They both looked at eachother like ""I'm not getting between that, you say something"", and knew not to cross their wives.

But when i hear the actor that plays quarich talk fondly about how in depth he is i cant do much but wonder where all the depth has gone. I truely wished the second movie would have quarich settle intio his own role and person. Maybe even seeing reason. But nope just turned na,vi but whacky.

And then there were these bullshit mechs that could fire homing rockets no matter where they were and they knew where I was going to be so they’d hit me every single time and there’d 2-3 of them so they were ALL doing it and there was so much chaos with other enemies shooting I couldn’t even figure out where it was all coming from before I die.

"""I genuinely challenge your claim that you've never met a young adult that's never been in combat, not be scared of combat and war"" Except we're not talking about a young innocent adult here, we're talking about a warrior who's been trained with weapons and is capable of killing hordes of humans a few minutes after waking up from cryo. ""A young adult that's never been in combat"" is only valid for the first few minutes of gameplay lmao, unless you REALLY try not to kill anyone in the whole game and avoid the main campaign. But that would be ""projecting your play style onto the MC"" and it's clearly not how you're supposed to play. This voice acting would fit a secondary character who's too afraid to go outside, not the main character. There's no way you're arguing in good faith right now.

What I experienced personally is that the urge of escapism does get FAR less if my life is interesting and fulfilling in one way or another. I don't know what your financial situation is, but if the winter blues hit you too hard, go to a nice public sauna with hot springs or something like that. Go see a lit up christmas fair in a neighbouring town with a cup of hot chocolate in hand. Try to see if you can book a last minute trip to some random ass beautiful location. It's hard thinking about pandora, when you whitness our earths wonders with your own eyes. That is ultimately also what Cameron wanted to achieve. To convey and evoke feelings of love for our own planet and beauty in nature. I can assure you, there is plenty. And reality is always better than imaginary perfect fantasy. Just how loving someone real and next to you, is always better than an obsession with a fictional character. I probably sound like a pot smoking hippy, but get out there.

Another little tip - follow your dreams. Sounds cheesy af Ik but that's what it's actually all about in life am I right? XD
Like, if you have a hobby you enjoy doing or a goal you wish to achieve - go for it. Sure you can work your 9 to 5 job for another 30 years that provides you with a stable income but why be a part of this monotony if it's not something you enjoy doing?
Idk your situation so maybe you do enjoy your work, then that's great and you should not give it up. But if one loses his dreams and goals in life, that life is gonna suck.

I won't pretend I know - it's Hollywood accounting in the end😀 But what we know - there's budget for marketing and it can be as high as production budget.

She often snuggles with her parents, both her mother and father. She has a big heart and her family is the most important thing to her.

Although Tuk is an avatar/Na'vi hybrid, like Neteyam, she was born with four fingers and toes, and her face is browless, making her look like a full-blooded Na'vi. Due to her age, her hair is still quite short, though her braid is now completely long. She wears a decorative necklace around her chest and a purple loincloth; she is also armed with a small knife.

Like her parents, Tuk is brave and will do anything to protect those she loves. In a way, she looks a lot like her mother. Emotionally, she views her family, home, and Pandora as most important to her and is inclined to be healing and nurturing. At the same time, she also gets a lot of her personality from her father, such as being reckless and a bit stubborn or brave.

Having grown up in the forest next to the humans at Hell's Gate, Tuk is used to experiencing cultures other than her own.

Like, if you look at other pop culture franchises that people will say had cultural impact, you’ll see much more permeation. Like, lotsa memes and meme  templates, an expectation that the general public will know about the the thing and have an opinion on it, at least one memorable quote in the public consciousness, etc.

When Neytiri is leaving with them with Tuk by the hand, Spider and Kiri are in front of her and she keeps saying ''stay close''. I can't tell if she talking to both of them or just Kiri.

He is clearly worth less to her than her children, but she's leaving him be for right now. I have wondered in the past on how she's gonna take it, if Jake starts to regard Spider as a part of the family (finally), but she can't.

This I agree with, but come on. This woman has been through hell and the cause seemed to be Spider's father. Not that it is right for her to blame Spider, but she doesn't trust that he won't follow his father's path. And not only that his closeness with Kiri must frightened her as well.

That is, unless we are supposed to view earth as an example of human recklessness and devastation that serves to further justify the violent repulsion of the RDA's colonization efforts, lest Pandora suffers the same fate.
In which case, earth becomes a symbol for humanity's ""cardinal sin"" of destroying the planet they were home to, and are now looking for an easy way out off-world.

Sure, there’s probably endless poverty, resource conflicts, alienation, etc but as a whole human civilisation keeps going, even as a decrepit mess.

This would explain why Earth corporations have enough time and money to be able to support a massive operation like the RDA, because there’s still enough (probably greedy) customers looking to pay for their products, and the situation at home isn’t so bad that something like off-world colonisation is unfeasible. It can also explain why so many people are keen to go to Pandora but there isn’t a rush to migrate there, because while there’s enough poverty and desperation to send motivate a few hardy people to make the journey, it’s not a literal apocalyptic scenario where everyone is trying to flee.

"What you’re saying is somewhat similar of a concept to The Last of Us ending’s moral dilemma. One that begs the question “does anyone have a right to another person’s life if it means saving yours and others?”

For me, the answer is no. You do not get to justify killing a child for a cure for humanity, and you do not get to legitimize burning forests and dislocating sentient inhabitants of another planet just because you ruined yours. You destroyed your own planet, now live with it, or find one that is empty that you can colonize, or perhaps come in peace and wait at the mercy of the new host planet to actually welcome you. 

Opening the door for making humanity’s actions on pandora to be justifiable will make it sound like colonization of actual world continents with the genocide of a whole population and the enslavement of another to be justifiable. Which we all know isn’t the case.

It may be an “understandable” perspective that humans will want to escape to another planet, survival instinct after all, but when that instinct infringes on someone else and the ravaging of their home, it is absolutely their right to defend themselves. 

And I really don’t want Avatar to waste a far more interesting premise both Eywa, a biological supercomputer that connects a whole planet, for a message that’s been done a million times already.

">Avatar isn't about Earth. It's about Pandora.

Uh, no.  Yes, the focus of the films is Pandora, but ultimately the franchise isn't about Pandora.  I think the whole point of the franchise is this.  Pandora is not way out there light years away from Earth.  Pandora is right here, right under our feet.

The Na'vi are not somewhere out there, light years away from us

We're the Na'vi.  The problem is that we're also the RDA.

If we are to survive and move forward as a species, the Na'vi side of our nature has to come to the fore and move past the RDA side of our nature.

Otherwise the future depicted in the films will be our future.

Avatar is ultimately a cautionary tale that, like all good fiction, holds a mirror up to us and asks us to look in that mirror.

&#x200B;

>So yes I do conclude that Avatar has an Earth problem and for the good of the franchise it needs to keep Earth out of focus for as long as possible. That being said this can’t last forever and we kind of know in A5 Cameron is going to shift the focus onto humanity (and presumably Earth) and ask how we (both in universe and IRL as a species) can go forward.

&#x200B;

Yes, this.  I think the series will end on a high note, with Earth and the Na'vi coming to a peace of some sort.  Perhaps the Na'vi will help humanity to heal ourselves and our world by showing us a better way to live.  Perhaps not.  

I think James Cameron wants to give the audience a sense of hope at the end of the franchise.   
I think he wants us to come out of the whole experience energized and motivated to make our world a better place, not just for us but for those who come after us.

That was the subtext of my fan novel and some of the better fanfics I read back in the day have the same basic idea.  Humanity must heal itself, but the Na'vi can help us heal, if we want them to.

I think James Cameron wants us to take action to make a better world.

I don't think he intends to show an utterly dystopian future Earth that has no future and ends up destroying Pandora in the process.

I think he intends to show us a better way for a better future for us and our world.

Humans are too greedy, will fight unnecessary wars over resources and turf and will finally destroy ourselves.

My personal theory is, that in A5 a last and definitive final battle is going to take place, like half the RDA staff is going to desert and join the resistance and the RDA if thrown of Pandora once for all.

Ok its spread out across a lot of small lore bits, statement by the cast and crew but the geneal gist is that Earth is a stanadrd Blade Runner future (isn't it sad that cyberpunk dystopias can be considered generic) where the biosphere has been so ravaged its starting to go into a death spiral that will render life unsustainable (even for a humanity that has made incredible efforts to deal with said collapsing biosphere).

In effect its like climate change, resource depletion, habitat destruction  IRL, the disaster might not be here today, but it is coming unless we take a radically different direction. RDA of course doesn't want to do that and basically acting now before the shit hits the fan to set up on Planet B.

When the British colonized half the world it wasn’t because England was going to sink into the sea. When Spain raped and pillaged the Americas it wasn’t because of desertification leaving Spain uninhabitable. Those atrocities were done in the name empires for wealth and power. Can you imagine what they would have been like if those countries were fighting for the survival of their people?

I won’t pretend humanity doesn’t have an interest in securing unobtanium and the immortality liquid. However there additionally is the whole Earths potentially collapsing billions would give anything to come live on Pandora. It’s a classic Us vs Them situation. The RDA sees the Navi will never let them take what they want so they are an enemy to humanity. 

The same way we currently read this on a device probably manufactured in a sweatshop. From lithium mined in slave camps in Africa. Where clothes similarly made in Vietnam or China. The people of earth won’t care how or where their salvation comes from only that it does. Either in the form of a home on Pandora or through the revitalization of Earth.",1,kr5j14s,Avatar,t3_1atqqc9,t1_kr5gqcp,1708359214.0

I expect we’ll see some reference to Alpha Centauri expeditions before the movies are done, I expect the way the movies end will set up all the details in the land that are there for anyone who finds them.",3,kr0jjlc,Avatar,t3_1atqqc9,t1_kqzq8qj,1708277503.0

I didnt say  i didnt.

And i did cuz im not racist, and also have a strong moral code.



The Na´vi are a sentient and intelligent species, and in Avatar the humans are actively opressing them. Im simply not supporting that. 

This means i must betray my own species? So be it.

  
BTW:

**I didnt say that i want humans to go extinct, i said they probably will go extinct** due to the fucked up way humanity thinks.

"IIRC the reason is mostly that their history is recorded entirely in song, the First Songs being universal as far as we know, and most clans don't really use any writing at all, so the language stays pretty consistent. The planet-wide neural network is probably the other reason.

"They don't know English. They are all speaking Na'vi, but it's presented on screen as English. Similar to in the Tolkienverse. Westron, aka Common Speech, isn't just English under different names. lt's another language. In the movies (and books, but I still need to read those), they just appear to be speaking English. It's basically like writing in English but using italics to represent someone speaking a different language.

When Jake is doing the voice-over near the beginning, his children are arguing in Na'vi, but as he is saying how the language is basically English to him now, they switch to English.

"I'd assume they do change a bit with regional dialects, as far as pronunciation goes, but all of the songs that record their history or are more ceremonial are said to be sung exactly as they were composed, so the language is more archaic, but prefectly comprehensible even after thousands of years",1,jq87pvh,Avatar,t3_14igs7n,t1_jq81l6p,1688189840.0

"I meant that the wording and structure does not change at all, even when sung today. The language itself has stayed consistent enough that you can tell it's archaic, but have no problem understanding it. Some words may have changed since, and pronunciation may vary a bit regionally, but they're still sung exactly the same and nobody has any problem understanding them.

Kind of like Shakespeare or the Bible, ""modernizing"" the songs could be done, but there is no reason to do so, and because they are about their history and beliefs I'd assume it would be improper to do so. You also wouldn't want to lose or alter any information, since these songs are how the entirety of their history is passed down.

IIRC the melodies and manner of performance for these more formal songs are also set in stone, as all of those also carry a ton of spiritual meaning.

The Bible has a very long and storied history of hundreds of changes that it has gone through when monks went to transcribe and translate it. And this is just for written text, the situation with spoken stories, song etc. is much worse as now you're playing a long game of chinese whispers.

(Shakespeare also lived around the time of the great vowel shift, so if you actually went back in time and listed to one of his plays while he was still alive it would likely not be completely intelligible unless you knew the script beforehand)

I don't have an issue with the na'vi's language not changing per se, because ""eywa wants to keep their language in sync"" is a perfectly valid reason as to why we dont see regional languages (although the real answer is just that there is no need for a scene where jake and co are learning other clans dialects) its just that songs and poems are a poor way of encoding this information because they usually dont store the exact phonetics of the song (for example, using the IPA to encode the lyrics to a beetles song) but rather the songs words which represent both a concept and the rough phonetics, if a clan started pronouncing certain words and phone's slightly differently without them noticing it could over time change how they pronounce and sing the first song.",1,jqa0c2t,Avatar,t3_14igs7n,t1_jq9w1jj,1688230038.0
