Tsutey shows contempt for Jake in a very universal way (side eyeing him, looking him up and down, shrugging him off). Same with Neytiri smiling and laughing. It‚Äôs all registers as human

I never considered until now that this could have been stronger if tjhe mannerisms were more alien...

"I agree.

While I still feel like TWOtW is my favorite film of the two (honestly the whales had a lot to do with that) - I did not appreciate Generation Z mannerisms being introduced suddenly (sorry). My best guess, as someone who's a great deal older than younger kids in their teens/20's who love this film, is that Cameron really wanted to draw you guys in. I think he was deeply concerned about not connecting emotionally/spiritually to younger audiences. Its clear that he wanted you guys to feel you could ""relate"" to the teenage drama aspect of the film.

Some of the things I really didn't like was the use of ""earth slang"" of human Generation Z.. like *""SICK""*... I'm sorry, but the Na'vi would not be saying ""SICK"" as a means of ""COOL"" on Pandora. It isn't realistic or even remotely plausible. Still, I tried to look past this as it was very clear to me that Cameron just wanted to reach out to this generation and welcome them into the Avatar world of ***SOUL*** contemplation and dare I say spiritual truth. He wants you all to contemplate what life COULD be like if you opened your hearts up to it. But he knows he must ""speak your language"" a little bit if he's to truly catch your attention. Or at least that's what he thought he had to do. That's my opinion.

He definitely over-humanized their mannerisms in this film far more than he did in the last film.

Overall, I think he did an exceptional job really reaching out to younger audiences and drawing them into new ideas about the genuine nature of the soul/spirit. Many younger audiences aren't even contemplating their own souls these days because they're so lost in social media and a superficial/artificial existence. They were *born into it.* They're more concerned about the newest ""cloud skin"" makeup technique than waking up spiritually. I can only hope this film will encourage younger people to begin researching metaphysical books and learning about a new world they didn't know existed.",3,j3n8yb8,Avatar,t3_1072j5v,t3_1072j5v,1673291644.0

So to the OP, they feel less 'alien' because Jake sees them as less 'alien,' and that feeling is largely portrayed through hearing significantly less of the natural Na'vi language and having significantly less screen time with actual Humans (and most 'Human' scenes heavily feature Quarich & Friends in Avatar bodies, kinda reducing the juxtaposition between the 2 worlds IMO).",25,j3myiex,Avatar,t3_1072j5v,t1_j3miwq4,1673287858.0

"You know that would‚Äôve been a great way to highlight cultural differences between the Metkyen and Ometycia and also give us a scene of characterisation between Neytiri and Kate Winslet‚Äôs character. 

For example, Neytiri didn‚Äôt want to leave the Forrest, but was in full support of her mates decision to take the family to the Metkyen. This demonstrates there‚Äôs a more patriarchal structure to Ometycia society than the Metkyen. 

If we were also lead to belief Jake was planning on going back to the forest alone after the family settled, and this provided some tension between Jake and Neytiri, allowing us to see a conflicted side of Neytiri between her cultural values and her desire to fight the sky people, while learning from the Metkyen‚Äôs Zarheek, a new way of family and community values that can accommodate her conflicted feelings, I think it would‚Äôve made for a more complete and interesting family story.

This has NOTHING to do with being ""generational"" or being influenced by his generation. I don't even know where to begin with how wrong of a statement that is. What it does have to do with is that Generation Z is mostly soulless and doesn't seem to realize that all generations that came before them actually have their spirits in tact. 

Generation Z won't even make it till the end of the decade, and that's probably for a good reason.

So they‚Äôre close enough to each other that information is being shared between clans in some fashion.

"Avatar 3: New Photo Spoils Key Scene With Spider.  While the exact plot details of Avatar 3 are still being kept under wraps, new photos may have already spoiled a key interaction between Jack Champion's Spider and an important character.

Despite being a newcomer to the franchise, Jack Champion's Spider played an important role in Avatar: The Way of Water. In the movie, it was revealed that Spider is actually the son of Colonel Miles Quaritch aka the franchise's big bad. 

Aside from the fact that one of Avatar 2's bonus features already revealed a key scene involving Spider, there is still so much to learn about the character's significance and it is expected that it will be further addressed in Avatar 3. In a new featurette from Avatar: The Way of Water's recent home media release, a behind-the-scenes look at a scene from Avatar 3 shows the first interaction between Jack Champion's Spider and Bailey Bass' Tsireya of the Metkayina Clan. The video shows Spider handling Tsireya a bottle of some kind, with the latter being in awe of this action. Given that the pair didn't share scenes in Avatar 2, it's possible that Tsireya's amazement could be due to the fact that it is the first time that she sees a Sky person aka human up close. Why Did Spider Go to the Metkayina Clan in Avatar 3?
At the end of Avatar: The Way of Water, the Sully family were mourning the death of Netayam while also being welcomed by the Metkayina Clan as one of their own. 

In Avatar 3, it's possible that Jake Sully wants to bring Spider as part of the Metkayina Clan as well, leading to his first interaction with Tsireya. 

The exchange between Spider and Tsireya could also hint at something romantic between the pair, which spells bad news for Lo'ak. Given that Avatar 3 director James Cameron already spoiled that Lo'ak will be the movie's narrator, it's safe to assume that a good chunk of the threequel could revolve around a potential love triangle between Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Spider. 

This is on top of the major conflict between the RDA and the Na'vi and the emergence of a brand new villain that would emerge from Pandora itself.

Avatar 3 is set to premiere in theaters on December 19, 2025.",3,jtjmf5m,Avatar,t3_157jv1z,t3_157jv1z,1690390468.0

"I'm also interested in the idea that Avatar 5 ultimately ends with the humans colonizing Pandora like they always wanted, and enough of the Navi (not just the Sully's but all those we've gotten to know in each movie) that are left over managed to commandeer one of the human starships and fly it to Earth. When they land, the navi are welcomed by fearful/hopeful humans left over on planet Earth, and what they end up doing is using the seed of Eywa to repopulate and rejuvenate Earth's flora and fauna. So the ruling class on Earth have now relocated to Pandora, and the Navi are now going to make Earth their new home. 

And the implication is that future Navi generations will be left alone, free to live peacefully, unhindered by humans (at large) who believe they've left behind a dying planet. This also implies that the humans, content with moving from planet to planet (the few that are able to sustain life), consuming everything in their path, will simply repeat the same mistakes they made until they run out of planets and chances.",25,kqhkbro,Avatar,t3_1ar6548,t3_1ar6548,1707969077.0

And the Na‚Äôvi return home and live happily ever after. But, like, maybe earth is like the matrix? 

Or maybe there will be replicants and they will overthrow the humans with the spirit of Eywa, and over millions of years evolve into a world like pandora?

Maybe since earth is dying and Pandora has a good balanced system, the wealthy of earth will start paying untold sums to have their conscious placed in a Na‚Äôvi avatars, and to protect themselves they will nuke the earth so no one can follow.

"I don't think it'll be ""the next *Star Wars*"" in the way you're implying. For starters, part of *Star Wars*' mystique is simply how *unexpected* a success it was. George Lucas was a relative outsider in Hollywood, with his only directing credits being *THX-1138* (an experimental sci-fi film) and *American Graffiti* (a teen coming-of-age film). The cast was almost entirely freshman actors with a couple veteran British character actors. It was turned down by three different studios before getting funding from Fox, and even then had to stick to the rather paltry budget of $8 million. The production was beset with delays, ran over budget, and its release had to be pushed back five months. Fox was so nervous that it would fail that they only opened it in 38 theaters. It was literally an overnight success, simultaneously defining a whole new genre of science fiction (nowadays dubbed the 'space opera'), and becoming one of the first true Hollywood blockbusters. In six months it was the highest-grossing film of all time, to the surprise of all involved, especially Lucas‚Äîhe had fully anticipated the film to flop.
pro
*Avatar*, on the other hand, was borne from completely different circumstances. James Cameron was a veteran director with over 25 years of experience whose movies had collectively grossed over 3 billion dollars. His last film, *Titanic*, had won 11 Oscars and was the highest grossing film of all time. From the beginning, he touted it as a visual and technical spectacle, and had little problem securing the $237 million budget for it. Before its release, there was a sizable contingent of box office analysts figuring it would be a massive hit, if not *the* massive hit. It opened to 14,000 screens nationwide, and grossed $1 billion in under 3 weeks. In 41 days, it became the highest grossing film of all time, breaking Cameron's own record.

Ultimately, I don't think *Avatar* will redefine the entire genre of sci-fi the way *Star Wars* did‚Äîthe genre is too massive and well-established for that to happen now. But beyond its many technical accolades, what I think *Avatar* will be remembered for is the fact that James Cameron intends for it to be his magnum opus. It's something that's literally been decades in the making, and he sat on it until he managed to secure the political, financial, and technical capital to pull it off. Because of that he's dodging the pitfalls that sank so many other directors' dream projects, like budgetary constraints and studio interference. Kubrick couldn't get *Napoleon* made, but Cameron did it twice and is on track to do it three more times.

I heard some criticisms that it was like ""Quaritch is back, boo!. He was the same"". But he wasn't. All the things you mentioned, that's why I'm really interested to see where he will go.

"I also love how she shows herself fully right in front of Quarritch, who spent the entirety of the movie calling her a beast or insane. 
The moment she is blinded by rage and full on ""beast mode"" is also (not coincidentally) the moment where she's the most relatable to us humans.

"See that's why it's fascinating to me.  His motivation is pride. But that's because the basis of his personality is a construct of Quaritch. His behaviour and his attitude of trying to be and act exactly like the person he is cloned after means that at some point, he is going to question and that the basis of his personality will start to fall apart.

The original Quaritch was highly prejudiced. Had outdated beliefs and hated the navi. Now this clone of him is carrying his mission. What becomes of him if for example he does wipe out the Navi?. The government will likely kill him too, and him being essentially Navi, puts his personality at odds with his personality construct.  It's no longer ""back water man against Navi"". It's ""clone with outdated beliefs of back water man"" and that to me is fascinating.",1,j0o85h0,Avatar,t3_zocn46,t1_j0o5umk,1671336471.0

"One thing needs to be made clear, Jon Landau has not confirmed that there will be no extended edition of The Way of Water.  
There was a misunderstanding on this subject.

He was simply talking about the fact that they do not have enough material to make that project speculated years ago by Cameron of two versions of the film, a 3-hour theatrical version and a 6-9 hour TV series version.

He did not at all deny a regular extended version as they did for the first film.  
Actually, he hasn't really talked about it yet so we don't know.

I sincerely hope they make it because this second film needs it much more than the first one given the various scene-connection problems that you have precisely described.",13,j4zkoo1,Avatar,t3_10fth16,t3_10fth16,1674124747.0

"Thanks for putting down in words what I also felt on my first viewing, the lack of tightness in terms of plot scripting and the editing flow being clunky at times. The 'start/stop scenes at random' thing gets more obvious once they reach the reef. It's baffling because Avatar was tighter (every sequence had a purpose and proper set-up that paid off ten fold) even though Cameron wrote it all alone whereas TWOW is loose and meandering lacking connective tissue even though Cameron hired several writers to help him this time around but it feels barely functional like a first draft with lot of ellipses that feel like glaring holes the more it went.",10,j4z80zo,Avatar,t3_10fth16,t3_10fth16,1674114353.0

There is a fantastic transition early from Kiri's ""you are not him"" line to the shot of Quaritch sitting on the shuttle with the breathing mask on, but a lot of the later transitions between the different story threads did feel off.

"Thank you for the detailed writeup. That sums up what has always bugged me with Avatar The Way of Water. Very surprising coming from James Cameron.

I remember watching his Masterclass, where he dissected entire scenes from Titanic and T2. Jim seemed more than aware of all those notions -setup, payoff, tension, release, pacing, etc. 

[Christophe Gans said that Titanic is one of the best-told movies ever](https://reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/10397yk/back_in_2009_film_critic_and_director_christophe/), which makes the three hours fly by. I agree with him and I also think Avatar is of the same caliber. Just think of all the hard sci-fi concepts he makes you understand without realizing how far-fetched they are.

What the hell happened for him to throw all that away with TWOW?

Edit: Gans added that what makes Cameron's directing style unstoppable is that he writes his own movies. Perhaps the co-workers he brought with him on TWOW to blame, as you mentioned?",9,j4ywp88,Avatar,t3_10fth16,t3_10fth16,1674106631.0

"I think u make a lot of solid points. TWOW wasn‚Äôt as tight as the original, partly due to it having to juggle more characters. Also the core conflict isn‚Äôt as strong. In the original Jake needs to become one of the people, so scenes of him learning the culture are integral to the main plot. Those same scenes also develop his relationship w Neytiri and allows the audience to explore the world. Jake had limited time to do everything. In TWOW the kids hanging out in water and learning to adapt isn‚Äôt as integral to the main conflict. Sure they have to flee bc of Quaritch, but the skills they learn aren‚Äôt integral to solving their problem. While scenes of the family learning to adapt allow the audience to explore the world like the original, the scenes have less additional purpose. There‚Äôs no urgency for the family to learn (Quaritch ends up finding them after they learned everything). The pure Na‚Äôvi vs half ‚Äúdemon‚Äù conflict isn‚Äôt explored much. The romance doesn‚Äôt want to seem to retread the original so there‚Äôs little conflict or depth to it.

1. I don‚Äôt think the swimming scene and Kiri being ‚Äúmissing‚Äù was supposed to be suspenseful or a conflict. I think it was just a way to cut to her and point out how she‚Äôs special (highlighting how she hasn‚Äôt come up for more air yet). I think the audience is supposed to become more curious about Kiri and less focused on the other characters‚Äô curiosity. It is another example of her uniqueness, like her sleeping in the forest. It also gives more reason for the Metkayina kids to single her out (Ronal pointing out her 5 digits, Kiri staring at sand).

2. I think they struggled w how to end some scenes. Like the kids swimming, the ending w Kiri is fine but I do see what you‚Äôre saying about it feeling off. When u isolate the scene, it doesn‚Äôt feel complete. When Jake comforts Kiri there isn‚Äôt anything else after Kiri says Eywa‚Äôs heartbeat is ‚Äúmighty.‚Äù They just have Neteyam and Aonung interrupt to segue into Lo‚Äôak returning.

3. I think letting the audience fill in obvious gaps is fine (like ppl can assume how characters got from one place to another). It‚Äôs a long film and u don‚Äôt need everything clearly explained/showed (ppl getting from one place to another, ppl getting together to talk). Like u assume Lo‚Äôak told Payakan to help him get home. When u look at that scene in its own, it is odd that it just ends w Lo‚Äôak chilling and holding hands/fins, but in context of the film it‚Äôs fine. I think bc some scenes end w an ‚Äúawe‚Äù moment (Kiri looking at fish, Lo‚Äôak holding Payakan‚Äôs fin) the scenes don‚Äôt feel as complete when u break them down.

4. The Metkayina disappearing in the final battle seems like a sacrifice Cameron made. He wanted to focus on the family vs Quaritch. Explaining y the Metkayina left wasn‚Äôt worth time. I can‚Äôt even think of a good reason for them to leave. Unless the humans got reinforcements which now need to be defeated, there is no good reason for them to leave (Tsireya is on the rock near the sinking ship).

5. Spider‚Äôs tracker seems like something they added to prevent a plot hole like ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt Spider just run away?‚Äù It will prob be addressed and quickly resolved in the next film unless they meant to in TWOW but cut that part out.

6. Despite rarely seeing characters go from A to B, I think the scenes are edited well together for the most part. All of the Quaritch/Spider scenes are sensibly spaced out between the scenes of Jake and the kids. A couple cuts felt jarring initially, but I think on review they work. They help w pacing (if every scene casually faded into the next ppl would feel the length more) and highlight the shift in tones.

7. I think for the most part, the film does setups/payoffs well. Other than a couple of things u said, nearly everything is setup. Kiri being ‚Äúmissing‚Äù underwater doesn‚Äôt have payoff, but it didn‚Äôt seem like a significant conflict/setup anyways. Spider‚Äôs tracker has no payoff as it was prob cut or in the next film. Kiri‚Äôs seizure has no payoff, but that scene actually sets up the ending w the parents seeing Neteyam. In future films Kiri will prob connect to the spirit tree again for an important reason and probably not die as Max warned.",3,j538ztn,Avatar,t3_10fth16,t3_10fth16,1674180792.0
"May I just say, thank you for writing this post. You hit upon something really astute here.

I remember watching an analysis of Avatar on YouTube once, and they made a great point about how every single scene in Avatar serves at least 2 or 3 purposes: some sort of set up, learning more about characters, introducing some foreshadowing, etc. It was never just 1 purpose to a scene (e.g. cool visuals!), it was always multi-purpose.

TWOW seems to be the opposite of that. It's as if Cameron and co. said ""The priority here is visuals and world immersion... plot and story comes second.""

For a 3 hour movie, TWOW tells a very thin story. If you're going to make a 3 hour movie, I expect Cameron to fit 3 hours of story. Use every available minute to the maximum.

Instead, it felt like the writers were lazy and felt they had unlimited time to meander and wander around. By no means can you call TWOW a 'tight' script.

It's such a paradox... TWOW has more runtime than Avatar 1, but feels like way less story. It suffers from the same problem The Hobbit movies had -- scenes play out in 'real-time'. Characters meander and wander around like they would in real life, without the usual tight structure of a film script where there's clear set-ups, pay-offs, and very little filler.

Even the 'filler' in Avatar 1 (Jake and Neytiri flying around) didn't feel aimless. It was Jake discovering himself and Pandora in these flights. Some of the scenes in TWOW, while very beautiful to look at, don't have the same feeling of purpose.",3,j58g00d,Avatar,t3_10fth16,t3_10fth16,1674271113.0

It definitely makes more sense when your consider the original script was then split into 2 and 3. So the way of water is the first half of an original script that was much more expansive. I think when they decided to make the first half one movie they had to add some stuff to flesh it out and it results in a clunkier narrative at times. It definitely feels like the ‚Äúmissing‚Äù factors come down to it being based on the first half of a story. In exchange for more sequels you‚Äôre losing the cohesiveness of one narrative that the first Avatar had the liberty of having.,1,j521ejz,Avatar,t3_10fth16,t1_j4z80zo,1674162588.0

"> I remember watching his Masterclass, where he dissected entire scenes from Titanic and T2. Jim seemed more than aware of all those notions -setup, payoff, tension, release, pacing, etc.

Yes! It's baffling.

Also, to the people mentioning the extended cut or deleted scenes -- guys, if you need a 4-hour extended cut to tell your story and make it feel cohesive, something is wrong.

An extended cut is great and should expand the story, but the theatrical version should feel complete and whole on its own. Just like Avatar 1.",3,j58h1rs,Avatar,t3_10fth16,t1_j4ywp88,1674271648.0
"I think two factors are the primary cause here. One being deleted scenes, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if there‚Äôs a 4 hour cut of this movie that helps fill in some missing connective tissue. The second factor that I think might be bigger is the fact he filmed this and 3 back to back. And when you consider that the third film is the second half of an original script that was split in half ( Way of water being the first half) you may find that‚Äôs where the disconnect lies. He probably filmed it more cohesively as one story but when it‚Äôs split into different movies some stuff will inherently get lost in the edit. The way of water was retrofitted from the first half of an original screenplay so it probably explains the loosesness of it too at times, being the first and second act of a larger narrative.

"> Even the 'filler' in Avatar 1 (Jake and Neytiri flying around) didn't feel aimless. It was Jake discovering himself and Pandora in these flights. Some of the scenes in TWOW, while very beautiful to look at, don't have the same feeling of purpose.

Those meandering underwater shots in TWOW are mostly just there to make you go *""Woah, ain't that beautiful?""* then stop arbitrarly but didn't advance much of anything in terms of character development and plot. And that's my problem, most of those ""beauty"" shots are all there is to them whereas in Avatar they played on different levels. 

For hence, the flying scenes in Avatar are exhilarating on a surface level but it's Jake learning Pandora's way of life and slowly getting closer to Neytiri's heart through the air. The seeds of their love story are getting planted in those flying sequences. You also get the Toruk attack during one of the flying scene that set up Jake's Toruk Makto sequence.

It's surprising coming from Cameron that used to write lean and well-oiled structured scripts all alone where every sequences propel characters/plot/themes forward. TWOW is no Aliens nor T2 in that regard.",2,j5ck6od,Avatar,t3_10fth16,t1_j58g00d,1674347718.0
"Yeah, it feels like a full movie being truncated in half. TWOW feels like the first and second act then A3 the third act.

In a proper standalone Cameron movie, the Seadragon battle would most likely ends up as the second act then the third act would be the build-up to the Bridgehead battle when Na'vis go over there to fight RDA on their base.

In my dreamt A2 movie, I really thought that the third act would be Na'vis and Spider hijacking the Seadragon and make it turn back to crash on Bridgehead as a Trojan Horse while a giant sea and air battle take place. You could still have Neteyam die as a martyr making Jake questions his way of raising his sons as guerilleros.

I also thought that Tulkuns and Kiri's powers would merge to provoke a mighty tsunami a la Abyss that damages Bridgehead. (Sigh).",3,j56kd7z,Avatar,t3_10fth16,t1_j521ejz,1674242569.0

"I think we‚Äôre going to find out that the NaVi or predecessors to the NaVi built Eywa and bioengineered Pandora and themselves to be the way they are. I think they decided to do this after nearly destroying their world in much the same way humanity is doing. Perhaps after so many thousands of years of living in a state of completely unalienated harmony with Pandora and eachother the NaVi no longer remember that it was them who built Eywa. Maybe we will encounter other clans, characters or factions who do still possess this ‚Äúhidden knowledge‚Äù.

I think this is likely the oft-mentioned ‚Äúholy fuck‚Äù moment in the A4 script. If this is true it will completely flip the ‚Äúnoble savage‚Äù trope on its head as well as breaking apart the barrier between nature and technology. Eywa IS the ultimate technology. It‚Äôs a real god, a real afterlife. When the NaVi go to Earth to heal it they won‚Äôt just be saying ‚Äúwe will save you because we just evolved to be better than you‚Äù.

"Remember that everyone Is the hero of their own story. Given the message James Cameron is trying to give through these movies, I don't see Eywa being described as evil in any of them. That being said there is the other side of the coin, people will always disagree, even if the message in itself isn't that Eywa is evil, many people will interpret it that way. 

By how Cameron is describing Eywa, she is a big administrator of Pandora who gives directives to the inhabitants so they will maintain the balance and never endanger the environment, I wouldn't be surprised if the ending of the saga would be humans also falling under the administration of Eywa and finally regaining their connection with nature, many people would call it a happy ending. On the other hand, many people would just see that outcome and interpret it as the bad ending, having an alien intelligence becoming the new overlord of humanity, taking away their freedom and turning them into its new pets, who will regrese them to the technological level of the Paleolithic. 

It is really a matter of perspective, having Eywa managing humanity like she does to the na'vi could mean that humans finally got back to their connection with nature, but many people would react poorly to this, since many humans value their freedom above anything else.

So I semi feel like that if Earth and Pandora are both left as planets fully functioning by the end,  I have this suspicion Pandora's gonna stay less what we would call Earth technologically advanced.  And whatever version of Ewya helps rehab the Earth, isn't necessarily going to  not be OK with human technological advancements but it's going to figure out a way for humans to completely integrate it into the environment. 

 I think it would be interesting to see some Na'Vi choose to live on Earth and be more I don't want to say the word modernized cause I don't think that's correct but I guess, something like that. Then there will be some humans that go to Pandora and live more integrated with the Pandora and way of life again.

"Looks pretty good! Looking at [human circadian cycle studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10839/), 30 hours seems to be within the upper range of what the human body actually can naturally support if not tend towards - supporting humans being able to easily enough synchronize their activity periods with the Na'vi. 

Further thoughts to add on - The massive moons will definitely adopt the axial tilt of their parent body, supporting the notion that the entire Polyphemus moon system has that same axial tilt. 

And Pandora is most probably tidally locked to Polyphemus, so the day-night cycle is entirely driven by its orbit around its parent and their common position relative to Alpha Centauri Alpha.",4,j0ouyrp,Avatar,t3_zor8we,t3_zor8we,1671351587.0
"I noticed something else that implies a rotation period of 24 hours. In the first movie when Jake is recording his journal entry, a ""date"" and ""LST"" are given. LST (probably) means ""Local Solar Time,"" which is an angle measurement, like Earth's Hour Angle. There are 24 hours in a circle (like there are 360 degrees in a circle) and the seconds are ticking over at a rate 1 angular second per 1 temporal second. This implies that that Pandora is rotating relative to Alpha Centauri A at a rate of 2 pi radians per 24 hours - exactly like Earth.

"So, I'm quite Intrigued by your findings.

First a question: for the eclipses to be seasonal (my working theory as well) the orbit of pandora would need to be offset from the orbital plane by a few degrees, otherwise we'd have eclipses year round, correct?

You say the axial tilt makes the eclipses seasonal. How so? Does the axial tilt influence the aforementioned offset orbital plane? Wouldn't Pandora always stay in the shadow of the planet if the or ital planes would line up? Or is the or ital planes of a moon locked to the rotational plane of it's planet?


Also an observation: whenever Polyphemus is in frame, you can see a swirl on its surface, which lead me to believe that it's always the same hemisphere of the planet that's turned towards Pandora. That would be a double tidal lock? Do you think that's likely? It seems very intentional to me.",1,j1mu5sr,Avatar,t3_zor8we,t3_zor8we,1671992820.0
Can someone explain the tidal locking in Pandora - Polyphemus system ? If Pandora has rotation time same as revolution time because of the lockz how come only one side is visible ( from Polyphemus ) ?

"I'd made the assumption that all major masses in the system had orbits that were coplanar (or nearly so) with Alpha Centauri B's orbit around ACA (that is, orbit momentum normal points toward approximately toward 7h39m right ascension, +10¬∫39' declination in ICRF) and would form the basis of the system's invariable plane. In our system, all major masses orbit within a few degrees of the invariable plane. Proxima isn't coplanar with ACB, but it's a very distant object. You're suggesting that the angular momentum normal for Polyphemus around ACA would be 29¬∫ from 7h39,+10¬∫39' and then Pandora would be 0¬∫ from that (eg [https://i.imgur.com/lWZJsKA.png](https://i.imgur.com/lWZJsKA.png) )?",1,j22yfwo,Avatar,t3_zor8we,t3_zor8we,1672297542.0

The morning to night period in the first movie where Jake goes to the forest, gets lost, then meets Neytiri and the clan didn't seem like it lasted a few days of our reckoning.

And until proven otherwise I'm just gonna assume that Pandora has a tidal lock; I don't think there's any mechanism where it can orbit so close to Polyphemus and avoid it.",2,j0t197b,Avatar,t3_zor8we,t1_j0oyb4x,1671425074.0
"When I say axial tilt I mean the axial tilt of Polyphemus itself relative to the ecliptic of its sun, Alpha Centauri A, which would also be true for all of the planet's closer satellites. It's like how Saturn's rings range from being edge on to the Sun (and thus having no shadow) to being open like two big handles (with prominent shadow), twice each over the course of its 29.5 year orbit. If its rings were any larger, then the outermost rim of them wouldn't be in the planet's shadow during the solstices. So my assumption is that Pandora's orbit is large enough that it avoids Polyphemus' shadow entirely for those parts of the year.

As for Pandora always getting a view of Polyphemus' giant cyclopean storm (for which it was named by humans; the Na'vi call it the Great Eye), I'm going to chalk that up firstly to Cameron wanting the beauty shots in every frame its in vs. realism. But that being said, Jupiter rotates once every ten hours, so we could probably assume a similarly rapid day for Polyphemus, thus the storm would be visible twice a day from every point of the planet-side hemisphere of Pandora.

"Or both, Pluto and Charon are mutually tide-locked. It is not a given that Pandora is tide locked, is it? I don't remember well enough, but I think for example looking up from below into the tree at one point Polyphemus was visible and at another time it wasn't, which implies that it is not tide-locked.

Baxter's ""The Science of Avatar"" mentions explicitly: ‚Äú Some close-in moons of gas giants are ‚Äútidally locked,‚Äù so that they keep one face permanently set towards the primary, as the moon does to the Earth. ***This isn‚Äôt the case with Pandora***; during its twenty-six-hour day Polyphemus rises and sets.‚Äù

"If it's 0.72 Earth-masses, orbiting a jupiter-sized gas giant at a somewhat ridiculously short distance, and is not tidally locked, tidal heating would reduce the surface to an ocean of molten rock.

Technically, a sufficiently large volume of water would dampen the tidal heating enough that it didn't melt the surface, but with these conditions that would probably present as tidal waves sloshing in an out of basins every 15 hours.

"I also havnt seen the movie in a while, so hopefully its still factfull.


 1. He was hoping the RDA wont find out where he went. Its always better to be somewhere peacful, then straight in the warzone, even when the place is fortified.


 2. He wasnt their kid. Also trying to get by in the water clan was their main objective, but its still quite weird how little they cared.


 3. He resisted. Also he would be more valuable, when he looked closer to Navis.


 4. He is stupid and bold, not a very good mix.


 5. People tend to forget your past screw ups, when you fix them. Also they saved the cheifs daughter and showed that they are willing to protect the tulkun in the final battle. I guess that was enough for the water clan.


6. She was seen weird because of the 4 fingers, but also because she was staring at sand. Something a lot of people dont do. Also the grass thing was special because it started moving and glowing.",3,jog4ouf,Avatar,t3_14bfvha,t3_14bfvha,1686988176.0
"1. Prior to leaving, the Omatikaya were in a declared guerrilla war with the returned RDA. Jake was hoping that by laying down his Olo‚Äôeyktan mantle and leaving with his family, the RDA would no longer pursue him. Yes, the Sullys could have hid with the Omatikaya at base, but for how long? With the Omatikaya at war, they were forever targets. By leaving, Jake was hoping to protect his family by severing his connection to the war effort. Unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work because Quaritch had a *personal* vendetta against Jake. There was a good chance that General Ardmore would have let Jake go if it meant an easier time fighting the Omatikaya. Ultimately, Jake made the wrong decision and it costs him a son. 

2. Only the Sully kids were friends with Spider, and Spider did not have a familial relationship to either Jake or Neytiri. So, yes, Kiri is extremely upset, but neither of her parents are going to go to extreme lengths to rescue him. Same with the other Omatikaya and allied humans. It‚Äôs a blow to the war effort that he was captured, but it‚Äôs not worth it to try to get him back in the grand scheme of things. There‚Äôs likely the general hope that with Spider being human and a child, the RDA would not harm him. Plus, Spider‚Äôs foster parents are at Bridgehead. The Na‚Äôvi-allied humans probably expected he‚Äôd be returned to their custody. It also works in the narrative as an example as to why Spider felt so alienated.  

3. Because he was in Quaritch‚Äôs care and he decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it after determining just how strongly Spider felt about the Na‚Äôvi and his Pandoran identity. Plus, Spider was immediately pulled in on the recom‚Äôs ‚Äògoing native‚Äô mission. It worked in Quaritch‚Äôs favor to let Spider be. It helped them develop a bond and get information from him that helped them in the operations. There‚Äôs no reason to treat him badly. He‚Äôs a human kid and there was no escape. Spider was desperate for the connection Quaritch offered him. Essentially it‚Äôs Stockholm Syndrome. 

4. Lo‚Äôak is a teen. A teen in a time of war, no less. He‚Äôs struggling with his identity and emotions and it‚Äôs entirely realistic for him to have poor decision-making skills. Lo‚Äôak isn‚Äôt going to have the same capacity of character growth as a mature, adult character. We do see him experience the consequences of his actions, which will follow him through the future films.  

5. Yes, Jake led the RDA to the Metkayina and put the entire clan in danger- Ronal and Tonowari acknowledge this. However, the RDA‚Äôs pursuit of Jake and his family opens their eyes fully to the extent of the Sky People‚Äôs cruelty and greed, especially when it comes to the Tulkun. Prior to the battle, Tonowari did not consider the Omatikaya‚Äôs war to be the Metkayina‚Äôs war. Afterwards, he acknowledges it *is* their war. Jake fought with the Metkayina. He learned Metkayina ways and buried his son in the sea. This is enough for them to be forever connected. 

6. Kiri is weird by Na‚Äôvi standards because she was born to an unconscious Avatar in what was potentially an immaculate conception. That‚Äôs a circumstance that is difficult for Omatikaya to comprehend. Jake has the mantle of Toruk Makto and Grace forged friendships with many Omatikaya, but, outside of these specific cases, I imagine the Na‚Äôvi cultural acceptance of Avatars took time and isn‚Äôt shared by everyone. Remember, T‚Äôsutey called Jake a demon, dreamwalker, alien, etc. Additionally, while you‚Äôd think a strong connection to Eywa would help Kiri, her connection is on a freaky level. Kiri has an ikran not because she made the bond in her iknimaya ritual, but because she went up to the rookery and *asked one to be her friend.* The Kiri-Jesus comparisons are actually relevant. In the Bible, people are suspicious and fearful of Jesus- his teachings, spirituality, and miracles disrupt the normal social order and eventually it gets him killed. Similarly, Kiri‚Äôs strange birth and borderline-miracles ostracize her a bit. The movie set Kiri up as a mystery that will be explored in the future films. 

Hopefully this answers some of your questions. There‚Äôs a lot of extra Avatar lore out there that expands what you see in the movie. This sub is a great way to learn more about it.",4,jomni9x,Avatar,t3_14bfvha,t3_14bfvha,1687122169.0

"You‚Äôre all good my friend! Thanks for the kind words :) In the last few years especially, I‚Äôve grown to love Avatar more and more, not just because the film unto itself stands the test of time, but it is **the** antithesis of so much of the conveyor-belt-made, essentially message-less, hollow, creatively tepid films that are being made nowadays (I don‚Äôt think I need to name names, I‚Äôm sure you know what I‚Äôm talking about). 

Thinking of the sequels being on their way gives me comfort ‚Äî it‚Äôs not outlandish to say that many of us, particularly younger people, take their cues of how/who to be from art and entertainment, and Avatar‚Äôs lessons could help ensure the upcoming generation gets off on the right foot.

Cameron realises that he has a responsibility, as a human being and an artist to himself, and as an entertainer and educator to the audience, to ensure the film becomes the best/truest version of itself possible.

Money is of course a necessary consideration, but it‚Äôs a means to and end for Cameron, 

whereas for sooo much of the committee-assembled drivel that have been on screens lately, money was **by** far the overriding motivation. 

It‚Äôs so transparent to see the sheer gulf of difference between Cameron and other, I‚Äôll just say it, Disney filmmakers nowadays ‚Äî and while I‚Äôm glad the company appears to be committed to the sequels,

I won‚Äôt entirely credit the Mouse House with them getting greenlit ‚Äî they clearly want quick turnovers, if you look at their other properties. So who made it happen? I‚Äôll tell you who:

I think Cameron *stormed* (Lightstormed, if you will) into those offices after the Fox purchase and said ‚ÄòLove some of your past work, and overall I‚Äôm happy with the partnership (World of Pandora), but when it comes to these four films, I don‚Äôt give a fuck if you‚Äôre the owners now. I‚Äôm not rushing these films for your quarterly statements ‚Äî you will let me release these films when and *only* when they‚Äôre ready, and we won‚Äôt have any problems. Mess with that in *any* way ‚Äî if you so much as try to shift those plans, give Avatar any kind of short shrift or rush us, anything like that ‚Äî and you‚Äôll always be known as the company that lost this project.‚Äô

I can‚Äôt be the only one who sees the slight incongruity of Avatar being allowed all this time to be made, while other Disney projects have to skip along to their schedules and financial projections like clockwork. 

That‚Äôs the power of Cameron‚Äôs conviction and clout.  

So far at least, relations between the natives (the Avatar crew/cast) and the RDA (Disney) seem to be amicable.",3,g14r7au,Avatar,t3_i7w4lm,t1_g14jt28,1597173341.0

> Unlike some religions from Earth, the Na'vi do not view Eywa as an all-powerful, world-creating deity.

The Na'vi know that natural disasters, disease, and all other natural phenomena are not the work of Eywa, but rather, are uncontrollable, worldly forces.

"I think there should be new sounds as the movies progress, however, ""A New Star"" has been stuck in my head for days (when humans return).  You can find the soundtrack on YouTube, and I think the songs are great when you listen to them on their own, but they aren't as powerful as the first movie.  I still enjoy them, tho.  90% of the soundtrack does not bother me and keeps me in the world.

I personally do not like the reuse of songs from the first movie.  Especially the song when the mother tulkun is killed.  I get that the song represents something horrible happened, but there should have been a new theme when something horrible happened.  It literally just brought me back to when HomeTree was destroyed.  Now I'm comparing the 2 scenes in my head and I shouldnt be but the music is now making me do that and taking me out of the moment.  

I guess maybe some movies work well when the same song is used again for sequels?

On the one hand, I love the constant easter eggs and callbacks to James Horner he works into his scores, while managing not to just sound like constant Horner pastiche (the balance in this score in particular is managed extremely well IMO, it could so easily have just been a rearrangement of the first score but it very much isn't despite clearly inhabiting the same sonic universe).

On the other, his own emerging voice is not nearly as memorable or distinct and especially in his action cues he seems to slide back into a very standard mode blandly competent music you hear in an average Marvel score. If he could just kick that one habit then I'd be fully on board with his ascent as a composer. He definitely shows promise when it comes to his themes, but I wish he fully realises more of his talent to give something like ‚ÄúBioluminescence‚Äù, ‚ÄúBecoming One with the People‚Äù, ‚ÄúWar‚Äù etc, especially with fire Na‚Äôvi being introduced in the next film.",2,j3ghevt,Avatar,t3_106duc3,t3_106duc3,1673177833.0

Harry Potter was a long series too, and though they retained the original John Williams ""Harry Potter"" theme for particular  moments, they had a number of composers work on those sequels and that did give each movie it's own flavor.

Some, not all, but some of the SW spin-offs like Rogue One, and more recently, Andor, have done some interesting things too, keeping things in the SW vein, but also making something original.  The latter was scored by Nicholas Brittell.  He's fantastic.  He scores Succession as well.

 As Mighty Joe Young came first, I can hear a sooo much of what he took from that, especially the quieter melodies, and reworked it into Titanic with heavy Irish influences.

I had the exact same reaction. It took me out of the movie and robbed the scene of its emotional heft. All I felt is *""WHY?! This is Hometree Falling's cue!""*. It felt lazy like a temp track left in. 

Also the editing really tried hard to emulate the reaction shots of the Hometree falling but it felt almost comical how it doesn't evoke a quarter of Hometree's shocked and ashamed reactions.

The Tulkun didn't give me the same feeling.  The animals themselves seemed......disrespected in a way?

Lo'at kills a fish but let's it sink, Jake shooting wildly at Quaritch riding a banshee and could easily hit the Banshee, Jake's skimwing grabs the banshee by the neck and pulls it underwater and could have easily killed it by mistake (it didn't, we see it swim away and comes back to Quaritch).  I know that the Tulkun were supposed to give us ""feels"", but I didn't feel connected as much as some.  They were just a catalyst to get Jake and company fighting.

Sorry, that's a lot, but my point is that because the first movie taught me that certain things were sacred, HomeTree being destroyed was devastating and this was enhanced by the music.  The death of the Tulkun mother was not enhanced by this for me.",1,j3h32hy,Avatar,t3_106duc3,t1_j3gw1qx,1673190543.0

It would have been perfect to reuse what you're calling the ""taps sounding"" melody.  Movies and sequels do that alot.

But then recently I saw it in standard 24 fps 3D (obviously not Real D), because this was the only showing that offered Dolby Atmos. And I have to say that the difference was massive. Sound was great, but there was a lot of ghosting (double image), and the 24 fps looked crap-ish. Like you I felt like the image was fuzzy and not nearly as crisp as I'd known it.

She is just holding her breath. It's why when they come and interrupt her, she takes a breath.",0,ji28ym9,Avatar,t3_12u58wm,t3_12u58wm,1682694207.0
">(6) She has a seizure underwater because she asked herself who her father was when she was an immaculate conception of her own creation, (system crash) not because she can't breathe underwater; but the seizure did force water into her lungs since it happened while she was underwater

When you do tsaheylu with the Ranteng Utralti (The spirit tree), it supplies you with the air you need to breath so you don't need to come up for air. Which is why she was able to let out air and yet still be alive even though water got in her lungs",0,ji29kif,Avatar,t3_12u58wm,t3_12u58wm,1682694444.0
">Meanwhile Kiri is exploring the depths, mouth in a massive smile, wide open, no bubbles. The boys try to keep up again underwater and again have to surface for air, then the Metkayina kids talk amongst themselves underwater before joining the other kids above when Roxto asks where Kiri is, visibly confused she isn't there.

For this part, if you know diving, when you go in even if you aren't experienced. Having a calm mind, relaxed movements and moving slowly like she was, you can last quite a while under water. She was clearly relaxed and calm, comfortable even in her environment. Almost like she was glide, probably on the current. That explains that. As for the no bubbles even with an open mouth, that can be done underwater in real life. Same goes for the ilu interaction. She isn't moving much and is completely relaxed and in her element there.",1,ji28dk3,Avatar,t3_12u58wm,t3_12u58wm,1682693977.0
">Norm explicitly says she can't do it again. For me, this is the weirdest part of the movie, because it does my man Norm so wrong. This dude studied the Na'vi language and culture for YEARS to come to Pandora for his science and such, he schooled Jake and others on the spiritual importance of certain things in their culture and emphasized how their bonds to each other, the animals, Eywa, their ancestors, etc. is what made them them, it is what made them whole, and that severing that connection could literally kill them. For him to be reduced in Way of Water to basically the antithesis of that by saying that Kiri, the literal incarnation of Eywa, can't connect to the spirit tree again, is just so so wrong to me. It felt so weird for that to be his role in the film. Foreshadowing Kiri connecting again and potentially something devastating happening

Yeah, they did Norm wrong with that, but he could only go based of what he knows, he is still a scientist. 
I don't think it is foreshadowing something bad but it is foreshadowing a big event surrounding her bond with Eywa. I don't think she is Eywa herself, but more of a reincarnation/avatar. She has her own separate mind, feelings and beliefs, but they are irrevocably linked.",1,ji2a4vm,Avatar,t3_12u58wm,t3_12u58wm,1682694663.0
