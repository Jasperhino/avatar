People re-watching the first Avatar movie and suddenly liking it so much more than in 2009 is more than just hopping on a trend,110,up5455,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/up5455/people_rewatching_the_first_avatar_movie_and/,24,"I've seen a lot of comments here about how people seem to have suddenly started liking the first movie after the trailer of Way of the Water. There's a lot of making fun of how quickly people seemed to switch from ""We decided to collectively forget about Avatar"" to ""Weeeeeeeeee ! The sequel has a trailer !"".  


I think there's more to it than that.  


The main critic that people had about the first movie was that it had a predictable, unoriginal classical white savior story. And I think we mostly agree on the predictable part, and I think the white savior story part is quite fair too (though there is some nuance to bring to that, and u/tallovision talked about that much better than I could here [https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/uoa0jk/comment/i8ddziq/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/uoa0jk/comment/i8ddziq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).)  


But if Avatar is indeed all that, it is far from *just* being that. Avatar is also the story of a disabled person escaping a situation where he is alone and stuck, from a planet where nature has been destroyed, to a moon that is colourful and full of life.   
He witnesses the nature of this planet, takes the time to learn about another culture directly from the people of this culture.   
He gets to walk and run again, then fly, he joins with a tribe and fights a monopoly corporation's mercenaries alongside them,  
He learns to know and love about Pandora and it's culture.  


Avatar isn't just a white savior story.  
It's an anticapitalistic story,   
It's an ecologist story, and to some extent, a naturalist one.  
More than that,  
It's a story about escaping helplessness and a toxic environment, about regaining agency,  
It's a story about finding (financial) safety (by getting rid of the financial part altogether),  
It's a story about connecting with nature, and literally, with the animals in it,  
It's a story about finding love, community, about belonging,  
And in a classical hero way, it's a story about becoming the best version of oneself.  


Long story short, it's a story about fulfilling our basic needs.  


I'd be willing to bet that a lot of us who have been fans for a longer time, have become so at a time where we also felt stuck in a situation where our basic needs were not fulfilled. At the time, Avatar allowed us to temporarily escape and fulfil our needs by empathy with the characters. Maybe also find hope for ourselves in the process, and community in the fandom.  


In 2009, most people had coping mechanisms that let them mostly fulfil their needs. When they watched Avatar, they only saw the white savior story, and probably the anticapitalistic and ecologist one.  


Now, we're in 2022. We had 3 years of a pandemic that forced us to stay in our homes, distance ourselves form each other, and in one way or another made us feel less safe. The USA have been increasingly polarized, there is war in Europe, I hear unfun things are happening in Asia too, and the IPCC is like ""WTF y'all, we really need to act about climate change *now* !"".  
Lots of coping mechanisms have become difficult to continue, and basic needs have been much harder to fulfil.  


So now, so many people who re-watch the first movie see what we saw in 2009. Not because of a jumping into a trend, but because Avatar, for most people, is just that much more relevant in this decency than it was to the last two ones.",1652487184.0
Spiders not that bad - How I Accepted that he wasn't as horrible as I though,57,11sb83h,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/11sb83h/spiders_not_that_bad_how_i_accepted_that_he_wasnt/,28,"**Like to start this with, I wrote out this like, 1000 word essay on why I think spider isn't so bad and then accidentally refreshed the page and lost is all. Here's an abridged version I guess**

First time I watched TWOW, I despised Spider. I mean, I really did not like him. The hatred didn't become outlandish but I wasn't looking forward to him being in future films.  I found him annoying as a person reminding me of every teenage boy I've had to deal with through my life, I thought his actions were unreasonable and that saving Quaritch made no sense (despite my delight that he did as a Quaritch fan). If I had been more in the fandom spaces, I likely would have agreed with all the Spider hate.

But with time and a rewatch, I've come to realise he's not that bad.  His annoying personality is really more of a defense mechanism. He's been abducted for the most of the film and so would obviously have his hackles up, and as he doesn't have a hope in a physical fight, he does what he can, which is to be massive bitch, which relatable and defendable honestly.

What I think a lot of people, who tend to be the teenage fans it seems which is understandable, forget that he is a child. Yes, 16 is an older teenager, but thinking of myself at 16 and other 16 year olds generally, I was practically still a baby. If I was put in the situations he was at that age (Probably even now and likely even when I'm older), I'd probably have just gone comatose or been crying in a heap on the floor.

He also practically has no family. His biological parents are, rightfully, hated by those around him. The monster stories of the Na'vi. That would be very isolating even within human groups. His adoptive parents don't seem to care for him all that much, not like close family would at least. They seem kind and accommodating but not like a *real* family.

The Sully's are who he'd call his family, but they don't seem to feel the same about him.

Jake describing him as a ""stray cat"" and Neytiri actively hating him. They don't care when he's abducted beyond him potentially giving away their operation, which he fucking doesn't.

Neteyam and Lo'ak do refer to him as brother but don't seem to care that much when he's abducted before the final conflict. Tuk seems to not care all that much but she is young, the age difference would also mean they likely wouldn't be close so I'm giving her a pass. Kiri is the only one who actively wants him in the family, but she herself is somewhat isolated due to the fact that her mother is Grace and she's not looking to forget that.

All in all this would be very isolating for him

So, I don't think it's all that much for, I'll say it again, a child to save the only man who seemed to have a somewhat active interest in them being family. Even though Quaritch says that they're ""nothing to each other"" this obviously isn't true as we see them interact more, Quaritch's first and last interactions being the clearest indications, along with him listening to him somewhat at the villages. Spider never witnessed Quaritch do anything egregious and although he would have heard the stories of what he did, it's rather hard to connect that to reality especially for someone so young. He also, from Spiders perspective at least, saved his life... somewhat. Whether you think Neytiri would actually have killed Spider or not, I don't think it's unreasonable to assume Spider may have thought she'd actually do it, and Quaritch was willing to give up the upper hand, to let them all go (for now) to save his life. You may be a little grateful, or at least less hateful in that situation.

Putting all that to the side, it's very hard to just let someone die.

**TL:DR** Spider is a very isolated boy who deserves more empathy than he gets. Saving Quaritch was a bad move but an understandable one if you look at it closer.Basically I think he's deserving of criticism but people are like, crazy mean to this fictional teenager. And I say this as someone who's often crazy mean to fictional teenagers",1678918626.0
Some thoughts on the Marine Biologist,42,zzgj4d,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zzgj4d/some_thoughts_on_the_marine_biologist/,12,"Assuming Ian Garvin  lived since we never saw his death, I wonder what his arc is going to be like? I really liked his character even though we didn't have a lot of time with him.

He clearly respects and has empathy for the Tulkun, but is stuck in the corporate stranglehold that wishes to monetize his CET-OPS work and research. A parallel to Grace in the first movie. Fun fact btw, Cetacean is the scientific name for the broad clade of ""whales"" (baleen whales, and toothed whales like dolphins). I noticed the ""CET"" right away since I study the fossils of these animals myself :P 

Anyway, I bet he'll have more conflict with Scoresby if he lived. If Scoresby did he is definitely going to take up an Ahab arc for Avatar 3 (i think he lived because Scoresby was very much alive when he got yanked into the water. Not much about what happened to him would kill him)",1672447029.0
(SPOILERS) Would you like to see Quaritch become the good guy?,38,zr0a12,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zr0a12/spoilers_would_you_like_to_see_quaritch_become/,35,"Personally I really would love to see Quaritch become one of the good guys by the end of the movies. The irony would be amazing, and even though it could be considered clich√©, I think for his character in particular it would be super interesting seeing him become more in-tune with Eywa and Pandora, seeing his reluctance to sing or participate in certain activities, or wearing certain clothes from being ""embarrassed"" as he is the tough military man. 
Especially since his whole hatred towards Sully is partially due to him perceiving Jake as ""abandoning his own kind"" in the first movie. 
But seeing him unintentially participating in the Na'Vi culture like taming an Ikran and call backs to the first movie with the ""Outstanding"" line, as well as the few times you see in his face empathy towards the Tulkun, and even Spider. It's clear to me personally that he isn't the ""same"" Quaritch as we know, I believe there are so many interesting ways they can take his character and would love to hear everyone's thoughts!",1671571777.0
Quaritch and Spider - divine fatherhood is hard to explain,27,10alkpq,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/10alkpq/quaritch_and_spider_divine_fatherhood_is_hard_to/,5,"When Quaritch agreed to release Kiri after Neytiri cut Spider's chest. Partly, the memory of the avatar Quaritch still retains Neytiri's ferocity towards humans, he believes Neytiri can kill Spider. Another part, maybe the father instinct in Quaritch at that time sympathized with Neytiri about the pain of losing a child, making parents can do anything to protect the remaining children.

Another part, maybe fatherhood - the instinct of fatherhood - is so miraculous that Quaritch has to do what parents must do, which is to prioritize the life of their child above all else.

James Cameron is not joking when he asserts that Avatar: The Way of Water is a FAMILY MOVIE, and he struggles to portray the main characters in parenting situations. They can't be as free and defiant as before, and Jake, Neytiri, and Quaritch both act on their new priority: protecting their children.

Besides the Sully family's story, I was also touched when I watched the Miles' story. There are many people who say it is unacceptable to ""bleach"" the Quaritch character, but again and again, this Quaritch avatar is a completely new individual. He only inherits the memories of the Quaritch human, but it is unlikely that he has the ""man is innately evil"". Being an avatar allows him to have perspective and empathy for the Na'vi. The fact that in the entire movie, he doesn't kill anyone but a tulkun, that clears the way for Quaritch to become an anti-villain in the sequel or even turn his back.

Despite only carrying Quaritch's memories, he actually developed a father-son relationship with Spider from the first time he knew who the boy was. Many cut-detail scenes show that, despite being less expressive, Quaritch has a fatherly instinct for Spider, from his rush to run to turn off the machine that is torturing the boy, to the times when he intentionally protects or Leave the boy in the safe zone every time he does dangerous missions. Quaritch is also quite ""indulgent"" Spider when the boy begs him not to kill the Na'vi.

In the opposite direction, in his heart Spider also wanted to be close to and discover family love from Quaritch's side. Actor Jack Champion confirmed this: Spider felt he had a ""responsibility"" to lead, tame Quaritch as well as save him because if he didn't, he would lose his true ""family"". Although he was close with the Sully children, Jake still considered him a ""wild cat"" when it was time to go, and Neytiri did not like people very much. Spider remained an orphan until he met Quaritch again. Of course, the instinct of a 15-year-old kid who has been yearning for his parents' love for so many years, Spider will look for the father image from this Quaritch avatar. Can't be blamed because I bet most of us would behave like Spider if we were in his situation.

I was really happy and touched when Quaritch backed down to save Spider. At first, he even said hard ""I'm not even of the same species"", but then he gave up immediately when he saw that Spider was REALLY in danger. The look of panic, unable to believe in himself and the other person showed that neither father nor son thought that Quaritch would make such a choice. There can be no more reasonable explanation than that at that time Quaritch had a sacred fatherly instinct and acted like Spider's biological father. We have seen a lot of bad guys being redeemed by love, but few have seen bad guys get their revenge thanks to the love of family, parents, and children. There are also many other male characters who are superficial with their children - especially if they are not directly raised from a young age - but James Cameron brings a ""cold-blooded"" soldier who is touched by his invisible fatherly instinct with his children. A new kid just met not long ago. Perhaps he thinks that motherhood and fatherhood are not something that has to be trained and experienced, but it has appeared and attached since the birth of a child.

After all that was witnessed, Spider still chose to save Quaritch. This time it's not just because he's his ""son"" but because Spider's benevolent nature shows him that perhaps this Quaritch can still be ""saved"". He's not a bad guy when he accepts to give up his knife to protect you. A fully developed, well-rounded father-son emotional arc from the very first moments to the very end - and utterly sensible. Quaritch did what a father should do, and Spider does what a son should do.

I don't believe the theory that Spider is ""blackened"" in the following parts because when he was so young and precarious, he still knew how to choose the right path. I also believe in the hypothesis that Quaritch will return in the following parts because, with the good seed that has been planted in this part, it is impossible to waste such setup effort.

Maybe in the part, after Spider was in danger, Quaritch would once again appear to save the boy because when he called him ""son"", he recognized its place in his heart. He will follow the path that Jake follows, from a defiant warrior to a cautious father with the highest duty of protecting his family.

So I never found A2's script boring, but it set up small details like a family sitcom so that viewers could empathize with each character before pushing them into a bigger fight. It's like when you watch a few odd movies before watching Endgame, you will feel sad and happy with the character.",1673585509.0
My predictions regarding Avatar 3's Ash Clans,25,zzlzn5,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zzlzn5/my_predictions_regarding_avatar_3s_ash_clans/,10,"[I've heard that Cameroon wants to introduce some villainous Na'vi characters in one of the planned sequels.](https://headtopics.com/us/james-cameron-avatar-3-plot-will-feature-ash-people-na-vi-33480914) From my understanding, the ""evil Na'vi"" are supposedly some currently unseen tribe known for now as the ""Ash People."" Apparently, they reside in some type of volcano environment,  have a heavy association with fire, and are far more warlike then their forest and ocean cousins.  Cameroon also made it clear in what I've read that he wants to flip the ""evil human vs good Na'vi"" dynamic present in the first 2 films a bit.

In Avatar Way of Water, Jake and his family were driven from the forest to the Metkayina's islands by  Quaritch's intensified campaign against him. If Avatar 3 follows a similar pattern, something is probably going to forcibly draw Jake and Neytiri to the ""Ashlands.""

My prediction is that ""Ash People"" warriors will come in and raid the Metkayina village where Jake and Neytiri have made their home. The raiders will kill a few villagers, and kidnap a couple others including one or few of Jake and Neytiri's children. Desperately wanting to rescue their children and the other captives, our protagonists will rally an expedition to the Ashlands.

As they're traveling to the Ashlands, the main expedition could encounter some stranded RDA workers. What likely occurred is that the Ash Warriors attacked and overran several RDA outposts in their lands, which scared away the RDA administers that survived. In their rush to escape the Ash People, the higher ups left the workers to their fate. Those that were left behind are now being mercilessly hunted down by the pursuing warriors.

By the time that the protagonists stumble upon them, there are only a few pitiful remnants left. At first, there is much distrust between the two parties, with the events that happened in the past several years. However, the heroes start to feel a bit of empathy for the workers when they start bringing up their families, and how much they miss or need to take care of them. 

Eventually an alliance is formed when it turns out the stranded workers have something to offer to the rescue expedition, which I think is probably something to do with being able to act as guides to help navigate the Ashlands. In return, the rescue party protects the stranded workers from the Ash people and other dangers in the Ashlands, and give them a safe passage out after they succeed with their mission.

"Why I think Aonung has more fans than Spider, but why some still hate both",22,15vizm7,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/15vizm7/why_i_think_aonung_has_more_fans_than_spider_but/,5,"This was initially just a comment on another post, but I made it its own post because it got way too long. Most of this is just my opinion you don't need to agree but I'd be curious to hear why you disagree. 

&#x200B;

[We are reflections of the people who made us](https://preview.redd.it/3cm74gegv2jb1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2810b792f82083cc525ab239acd6d8f2b629d616)

&#x200B;

[But they do not define who we become.](https://preview.redd.it/hmn91q8jv2jb1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=baabf4d74db5c1989a9594c1c1b49df339f96daa)

So Spider and Aonung don't really have a lot in common except a lot of people seem to hate them, but it seems Spider gets the majority - but honestly, I think a lot of the hate for Spider is understandable though the hate for Aonung feels less so. 

I believe in second chances and I think it's just reductive to label a character or person evil forever for the bad actions they did at one point in their life. I'm not gonna defend anything he did or said, he was awful and legitimately could have killed Lo'ak but if Lo'ak, Kiri, and Neteyam can forgive him and learn to trust him then why can't we as the audience, people who hate him act like they've never done or said a terrible thing before. If anyone says that, they're a psychopath or a narcissist.

People are allowed to change and grow, most people would admit they were awful at age 14 because teens are just bad people. That's a fact, there are some exceptions obviously but generally speaking, they all suck. There's a certain lack of empathy due to ignorance that comes from that age group (especially in more developed countries) and thankfully most people grow out of it.¬†

Aonung is also younger than Spider, so I'm more forgiving of his faults. Not to say I hate Spider though, I actually love him as a character but I understand the hate he gets. His motivations and thought processes weren't defined enough for people to understand his actions in the movie, they felt he was aiding the villains and when he saved his dad (our main villain) and then returned to the Sullys like nothing happened it supported some people's dislike of him, it felt very deceptive and a like big ol middle finger to Jake and Neytiri for all the effort they put into killing that man. Even if you understand why he did what he did it was still arguably a bad decision because ultimately that man he saved is just gonna kill more people and that blood will be on Spider's hands unfortunately. But the most human thing is to do something you ultimately regret later in life. Also, sidenote Spider killed a lot of humans when he sunk the ship, not like I sympathize with the RDA but I did feel a little bad seeing those people in the lower decks just being crushed against machinery with water, I'm pretty sure they were just doing their jobs keeping the ship running and weren't all bad people. Plus Spider was smirking after murdering a couple dozen people so... um anyway moving on. 

To conclude though I'll admit most of the love Aonung gets is probably because he's shipped with Neteyam, and they look visually pleasing together. That's just the nature of it and it's shallow but it is what it is. Some people like seeing two hot guys together, this is a well-documented fact of history. Like people shipped Draco and Harry and he was ten times worse to him than Aonung was to Kiri or Lo'ak, for multiple movies/books too mind you. Aonung has only had one appearance and very little screentime, we don't know what he's like when he's alone or with loved ones - he could be a completely different person because people tend to act differently depending on the people around them.¬†

This is a long-winded way of saying Aonung is a complex character and he has the potential to become a great one, what's wrong with giving him that chance? If anything at least it'll be an interesting redemption arc. As for my monkey boy, while I think he's a kind-hearted and good person (allegedly) I would like him to take a little dip in the dark side, why not? Could be fun I'm here for the angst. Even if it's predictable it could be interesting if done well, I'm seeing a dark reflection of Jake's arc. His saving of his dad would have been a great catalyst for this dark side arc, I would have liked it if he left with Quaritch and they go to the Ash clan together - let's be fair here the Sullys abandoned him and he probably would have been tortured to death if Quaritch didn't stop it and Neytiri definitely would have killed him at the end so I would completely understand if he left with him, not because he loves him all of a sudden and thinks he's a saint but maybe because he think's he can change him. This is often a thing children and adults with bad parents go through, maybe if I love them enough they'll love me enough to change. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't but it's a completely understandable thought process for someone in that type of family, most people only ever get one set of parents and one has to deal with the hand they are dealt.  It is our nature to love our parents it's a survival mechanism, even when it hurts us to do so. 

Personally, my only real issue with Spider is he's a very passive character (in story terms not literally), he doesn't make a lot of choices in the movie. Things happen to him - he's taken, he's tortured, he's saved, rinse and repeat. His personality is also not very well defined and his dialogue is clunky at times. Hopefully, those will improve in the next movies because I do think Jake Champion is a good actor overall. 

Well, that's my thoughts and opinions on the two I got many of them clearly. Thank you for taking the time to read my ramble. What do you think about them though?",1692458394.0

I‚Äôm not the only one that realizes that the ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù forces on Pandora are actually mercenaries right? ‚ÄúBut out here they‚Äôre just hired guns. Taking the money. Working for the company.‚Äù I mean that‚Äôs a literal quote. Yes, I know to an extent that‚Äôs arguing semantics - but to my understanding the kind of people the RDA (the company behind it all) would hire would basically be people who would have the ‚Äúright‚Äù attributes they‚Äôre looking for such as: 

- Dishonorable discharges (particularly of those for breaking rules of engagement)
-Possibly anyone facing court marshal (even better for the purpose of the RDA‚Äôs recruitment if the individual was being tried for aggression toward civilians either on or off deployment)
-Excessive aggression
-Low empathy
-all the while having a high skill set in their field with a measurable lax moral code of how their skills are applied.
-Add on the people who will literally commit the worst crimes imaginable for a big enough pay check

This obviously didn‚Äôt/doesn‚Äôt apply to *everyone* they hired, as obviously Trudy (pilot from the first movie) and Jake are still good people and former military. So with that in mind there could also be a high amount of coercion going on. Possibly to the extent of, ‚Äúdo what we say or you‚Äôre never going home to earth again.‚Äù 

Not to mention that (from what I‚Äôm learning from going more into the professional world) that odds are the reason the RDA feels so confident in breaking over what I would guess to be about 50 international laws or so - at least a dozen of which literally applying to mercenary organizations and another ten for their environmental abuse - revolves around a few things:

-Jurisdiction: the earth governments are not able to stop them because they frankly *need* to actually be there in order to enforce the laws the RDA breaks like a kid opening presents on Christmas.

-It‚Äôs highly likely that the RDA censors a lot of the facts of what actually goes on Pandora and rigorously only bring on world operators that will have incentive not to blab (see the qualities above), especially after the events of the first movie.

-There‚Äôs an excellent chance that the RDA may have greased the right palms to ensure that just in case there‚Äôs any bad publicity, they‚Äôd still be able to get their goals accomplished.

Where Avatar TWOW missed the mark for me,7,105oq8s,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/105oq8s/where_avatar_twow_missed_the_mark_for_me/,8,"To preface this, I absolutely had a blast watching this film and I think there is nothing wrong in levying constructive/valid criticism towards a  beloved film in good faith.  In TWOW, Cameron's directorial DNA is present in full effect just like in Terminator 2, the ostensible breathtaking visuals and cinematography, stellar performances delivered by the actors/actresses, an amazing soundtrack (I love Songcord), a high stakes tension-inducing 3rd act with epoch action sequences and wondrously delivered worldbuilding of The Metkayina Na'vi clan located on Pandora's reefs. James once again has delivered on all these facets of filmmaking as you would expect from him and his past filmography.  However, after recently rewatching both TWOW and Terminator 2, I've noticed that there is one thing that Avatar TWOW lacks that hinders it to reach the critical acclaim and notoriety of Cameron's deemed magnum opus Terminator 2. The biggest flaw of TWOW stems from its lack of character work and having a script/screenplay that gives the impression that it was more of a first draft. Before I go off rambling about this, I  wanted to say that even though I found most of the character work in the film to be underwhelming and lacklustre, the characterisations and performances of the Sully family, Spider and Quadritch were more than engaging and I found the characters to be really likeable to a certain extent.

https://preview.redd.it/zvbtudq1alaa1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=1682ccbc002acc3396cabb3fa797e2fa1b8a5fb9

First off, the most underutilized and sidelined character in the film was  Neytiri. I absolutely loved Neytiri in the first film and Zoe Salda√±a's performance was nothing short of empowering and gut-wrenching. In the first film, Neytiri was THE primary agent who propelled the plot of the first film - her choice to spare Jake, her choice to take him to her people, her choice to teach him, and her choice to love him were all  FUNDAMENTAL to the first film. Remember, at the climax, it isn't Jake's fight with Quaritch that saves Jake and cements his connection to his new life, it's Neytiri's love. Neytiri is arguably the most complex and tragic character in the film, however, she plays a more passive role in the backdrop and the film divulges little to no time to flesh out her character even more and draw emphasis to her internal struggles. We see  Neytiri lose her father, her hometree, her sister, and nearly lost the most sacred site to the Omaticaya and subsequently, hundreds upon hundreds of Na'vi lives during the battle for the Tree of Souls. It would have been nice if the film drew more focus on her turbulent feelings of leaving the Omaticaya and the losses she suffered in the last movie vie throughout the 2nd act, which would've been a natural progression of her character from the first movie. Her dynamic with  Spider is super intriguing as an unbridled relationship in which Neytiri is established in the sequel as harbouring resentment and a deep-seated animosity toward any/all humans. Once again the film should've drawn more emphasis and fleshed out Neytiri's animous behaviour towards humans and her relationship with Spider besides a couple of lines in the beginning monologue. This exploration of loss, fury and emptiness is would've made Neyetam's death that much more gut-wrenching and distressing. This is one of the reasons why Sarah Connor in T2 became such a hallmark character in which we saw her character progression from movie to movie when it came to her isolating desperation to stop judgement day, sacrificing her humanity to stop Skynet by killing Miles  Dyson, her tumultuous relationship and eventual respect of the  Terminator and being an emotional support pillar to John as she tries to grapple with the death of Kyle in the first film. There was plenty of opportunity for Cameron to explore Neytiri during the second act and while I'm sure they're leaving some of this exploration for future sequels, it comes at the expense of her being in a diminished role in  TWOW.

Performance-wise, I found all the Sully kids to be compelling and I loved how the film established a theme of being an outcast. Although the screenplay and script fall susceptible to be very tropy, predictable and conventional, I still very much enjoyed watching Kiri and Lo'ak being fleshed out during the 2nd  act and Lo'ak and Jake having that payoff at the end. Where this falls apart however is when it comes to the character of Spider. The character and thematic symbolism of Spider is very interesting, where he is essentially the inverse of Jake Sully, a Na'vi in a human body,  spiritually fulfilled but materialistically lacking. 

I thought this was a  beautiful chance to comment on the superficiality of his 'Na'vi'ness,  how no matter how much he feels like one of them, he will never be able to experience their connectedness to their home and culture. Maybe this is why Neytiri struggles to love someone in a human body. Maybe the ability to physically connect with someone else is an absolute requirement for empathy on this planet, and from Neytiri's perspective,  this would make Spider an anomaly. That's such an interesting concept to me, and it's not touched on at all. My biggest issue with the movie was also Spider and Quaritch's relationship which was executed sloppily.   It felt rushed and underdeveloped, like more of the movie should have been dedicated to developing their motivations and arcs more. When it comes to Quadrich, the film does too little to show us what it feels like for someone who is fundamentally anti-Na'vi to wake up in a body he not only despises, but that can plug into anything on the planet,  allowing him to feel its emotions in his own body. We get nothing about how this impacts Quaritch's perspective and it's bizarre, given how much it impacted Jake, a very similar character, at least in terms of his background.

I think this whole  ""simple-storyline"" riff-raff as a way to criticise the film negatively is extremely misplaced. For instance, Terminator 2 is a pretty simple story"" protect John Connor and stop Judgement Day,"" but is enriched by all the characters being delved into and that's why the journey from beginning to end feels satisfying. I think the number 1 element that's missing from TWOW that stops it from rivalling or reaching the heights of something like Terminator 2, is the lack of a sharp and concise screenplay/script that facilitates the exploration of these multifaceted characters. There needs to be more screen time dedicated to fleshing out these characters, making the viewers care about them on a deeper level. Most of the arguments that I can see being made is that there are more sequels coming out that will accomplish this, however, that comes at the expense of this movie feeling unsatisfying by itself. All in all, I immensely enjoyed TWOW and even though I can acknowledge its flaws, it truly is a film conceived by Cameron that has a lot of heart, sincerity and passion, and I can't wait to feast my eyes on these upcoming sequels.",1673097139.0

Welcome to the [Na‚Äôvi Nation](https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Avatar-10-anniversary-impact.jpg), my friend üôè

You‚Äôre in good company here ‚Äî 

positive and accepting vibes only here (though not without a little light-hearted friendly [competition](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMXdHKSJKoV/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) üòâ),

along with a profound group-appreciation of **indigenous storytelling and mythologies**, 

which predate the *currently* dominant (until 16 December 2022, that is üåÖ) superhero genre by several tens of thousands of years, 

and which **Avatar** acts as an all-unifying, universal signal-booster of:

encouraging viewers to dive into/become more aware of (and active towards, balancing escapism with activism),

‚Äòour own Pandora‚Äô ‚Äî 

planet Earth, and its native peoples and flora/fauna ü¶í üå± 

A unifying beacon for the unending collective battle to ensure we don‚Äôt (as Jake Sully puts it) **‚Äòkill our mother as well‚Äô** üôè

Someone here raised the topic of Avatar having lost its resonance with the public ‚Äî

 I‚Äôd not say ‚Äòlost‚Äô,  so much as 

*intuitively/tactfully receded into the background for the time being‚Äô,

whilst the world slowly allowed itself to become addicted to **‚Äôconveyor-belt filmmaking era‚Äô** (‚ÄòSuperhero films, etc.)

[Note: Disney itself **buying Avatar** and greenlighting all the sequels is a sign that even *they* know a change is coming ‚òùÔ∏è)

Similar ‚Äòfad-spans‚Äô have occurred in cinema history before (the Spaghetti western boom, etc.) üé• 

I discuss this on [The Avatar Podcast](http://instagram.com/avatarpodcast) üéô , and in my interview with [KnowYourMeme](https://bypasser.glitch.me/?q=https://www.reddit.com/user/AvatarPodcast)

By when Avatar II debuts, that decade-ish long period will thankfully be over üôè

The thing about entertainment made *that* fast, 

with such an emphasis on the ‚Äòcookie cutter‚Äô method, 

the crucial *timelessness-ensuring* component of **artistry** (with a few exceptions, such as Guardians of The Galaxy), rapidly dissolves/dilutes, 

leaving the whole ordeal feeling, by and large, hollow (anyone who‚Äôs tried to watch Falcon and the Winter Soldier can attest to this ‚Äî I love the creators involved, but the series feels like a same-y and needless over-elaboration of the brilliant Winter Soldier from 2011) üëç 

I have no problems with such films unto themselves, 

only the sheer **volume** at which they‚Äôre being made and released (another one I‚Äôm looking forward to is Doctor Strange 2, which looks set to take things into an interesting multiverse-hopping direction) üôè

What Avatar‚Äôs universe is set to offer,

With its already-photorealistic (and thus empathy-engaging, which is the whole point of it in the first place) receiving an additional decade-plus of refinement,

between its contained 5-film cycle across 20 years (you read that right ‚Äî anticipate a slight delay of Avatars 4 and 5, making this a cohesive, 20-year long 2009-2029 artistic statement),

And it‚Äôs various upcoming multimedia continuations (namely the has-the-potential-to-be-powerfully-Meta Project Avatar from Ubisoft, which thanks to the power of current-gen will directly import CG assets from the films),

Is **DETAIL** (as exemplified by Pandorapedia).

Something that, in their quest to cover as much ground as possible (making a solo Disney Plus series for Spider-man‚Äôs roommates‚Äô tennis partner ‚Äî that‚Äôs me playfully poking fun üòâ), this recent decade of superficial-feeling films simply hasn‚Äôt allowed itself to do.

Detail, as well as a powerful and earnestly timely **MESSAGE** (I‚Äôm not talking some throw-away lines about saving the planet, as briefly brushed upon in Endgame),

that **unequivocally** puts its money where its mouth is (Cameron openly used Avatar‚Äôs popularity burst in 2010 to signal boost the Amazon region‚Äôs beleaguered ecosystem and cultures).

Lastly, something Cameron seems to be powering for with all his technical/creative/storytelling might, is waving a multi-billion dollar flag for **INNOVATION**, versus constantly, deleteriously, nauseatingly playing it safe all the time. That‚Äôs why,

Just like Gilligan with Breaking Bad, the Avatar project will be a contained twenty-year statement from Cameron ‚Äî a focused, fully-planned our project, unlike the recent haphazard Star Wars projects, which ‚Äî speaking as a childhood SW fan, and host of [The Star Wars Podcast](http://instagram.com/starwarspodcast)  too ‚Äî had honestly had it‚Äôs time üôè

And after Avatar, another torch-bearer for these eternally worthwhile causes will come to prominence, and like an organism defending itself and rallying to the ‚Äòlead white blood cell‚Äô, art will continue its eternally sacred duty as 

1) pertinent cautionary tales (we‚Äôll have The Matrix to thank 100 years hence for why such a future never came to pass, just as we‚Äôll have Avatar and the activists it inspired to thank when Earth is still a verdant place thousands of years hence), 

2) Trojan horse delivery mechanisms of timeless self-enriching and compassion-awakening lessons disguised as fantasy escapism,

3) and pure and simple dazzling entertainment üíôüíôüíôüíôüíô

Went a bit long there, 

But some of the recent optimism on this subreddit since ‚Äòthe great turning of 2020‚Äôs particularly heavy page in history‚Äô inspired me ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

So welcome once again, friend!

Thoughts on Quaritch and the future films?,4,108riod,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/108riod/thoughts_on_quaritch_and_the_future_films/,4,"So I have some thoughts on Quaritch that I‚Äôd love to hear some input on. Do you think he‚Äôs gonna have some sort of character growth story arc?

Starting all the way from when he woke up he‚Äôs definitely been off and different from himself as a human. His first instincts when he woke up wasn‚Äôt to yell or shout, it was instinctive hissing, like the Na‚Äôvi do. He somehow knows some Na‚Äôvi language (though that may have been included during the imprinting process to give the recons a tactical advantage?) and tries embracing certain Na‚Äôvi ways so that he can think like them and predict their moves, despite NEVER showing a single ounce of interest in ever doing these as a human. When they interrogate Spider he shows empathy and helps him, admittedly he‚Äôs his son (technically) but something about it still felt off about when he turned off the machine considering his old characteristics, especially when they seemed close to actually getting a location out of him. Then when they attack the first reef clan village, even Weinfleet asks if they‚Äôre really gonna just kill the Tsahik, I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs defo something both of those guys wouldn‚Äôt have even flinched to do in the first film. When Spider begs for him to see this is wrong his facial expression definitely flashes to something like reluctant realisation or recognition? During his entire search for Jake he killed NO ONE in the villages (excluding the final battle). Even after they capture and kill Roa (the mother Tulkun) and Scorsby is joking around about the situation he‚Äôs very quite the whole time and sometime looks just fed up or unimpressed by Scorsby‚Äôs attitude despite defo having that same attitude when taking down home tree and being so trigger happy to do so.

It just feels like a lot of the actions he would‚Äôve done without a second thought in the first movie is slowing being seen as distasteful even to himself. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôll have a full on redemption arc or suddenly go pro Na‚Äôvi as I feel he‚Äôll always be after Jake and his family for revenge for his human death, but I feel like he‚Äôs slowly drifting towards some sort of respect for at least their ways.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because being a recon he‚Äôs got some sort of primal instinct from his biological connection to the Na‚Äôvi, hence the hissing and language, or if it‚Äôs him seeing these actions through Spider‚Äôs eyes and not liking how Spider sees him for it. Either way I feel he‚Äôs got an arc or some character development in front of him in the future films and I‚Äôm excited as heck to see where that goes!",1673400429.0
Tree cult theory,5,gc7wvd,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/gc7wvd/tree_cult_theory/,4,"Okay so, me and my brother were talking till 2 o'clock last night about this (probably how we came to this conclusion) 
We believe the tree of souls was a capsule fired at Pandora millions if years ago by very advanced aliens. Pandora was unlivable but the tree is a terraforming device that made the planet that is so very close to a gas giant a lush wilderness. 
Look around the tree of souls, it is resting on a circle platform and there are spheres around it, it looks like a spaceship wreckage. 
Every living thing on Pandora worships eywa, even the animals. It has incredible influence over every living creature on that planet. But, it is also very curious and wants to learn about new things, like the humans. It could have easily made all the living creature in the planet attack the humans as soon as they landed, but it didn't, it wanted to learn more about them since it had lost contact with humans billions of years ago. If you remember, Jake said ""they killed there mother, and they are going to do the same here"" the tree learned that if the nav'ii ever got past the stone age, they might advance past needing a god and cut down the tree of souls, so it made sure to never let them advance more.
Okay, so if you just sit and think about it, Jake betrayed is own race, for these aliens that he has known for 3 months. Because he had such close proximity to the tree, and using his hair tentacle on all of the animals there, he became indoctrinated by the tree. The other people who betrayed their own race were a bunch of scientists who had close proximity to the tree roots. And another reason why Jake was so easily swayed was because ""his cup was not full"" that is why the colonel never succumb to the tree, even after being on Pandora for years, because his cup was full, he wanted to save earth. Another person who gave her life defending the tree was Trudy. Why would she suddenly have a change of heart? Just to save a tree? She was indoctrinated because she spent so much time in the mountains. 
Now, the tree only actually turned violent towards the humans when they threatened to kill it, because it only cares about itself. 
And I've always wondered why the na'vi never fled when Jake told them the sky people were coming. The tree knew there were too many na'vi so it didn't care if a few died, and it also used this to implant empathy into more humans, including Jake who then wanted revenge on the humans. It needed Jake to survive because it foreseen that he could be a willing vessel for it to act through.

I might have missed a couple things out, but I'm curious what you guys think of this. I know it may be far fetched, but, yeah.",1588431871.0
The movie really surprised me | IMAX 3D is the way to go,3,102dw2e,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/102dw2e/the_movie_really_surprised_me_imax_3d_is_the_way/,0,"I had watched Avatar when it first came out and while I liked it, I didn't love it. It was different but nothing that really made me want to watch it a second time around. With Avatar 2 though, something strange happened. While the first 45 minutes were nice, I was getting the same feeling again. It seemed to be heading in a similar direction - simplistic story, nice visuals, but would probably end up being just eye candy. However, once Jake's family headed to Awa'atlu to be with the Metkayina clan, things really became interesting and I was hooked for the next couple of hours. The relationships, story, visuals, empathy towards the sea creatures, was really well thought out. The hunting of the Tulkuns had so many parallels to cruelty in today's world. I thought the pacing was excellent and I really enjoyed the movie. So much so that I watched it two more times (in Dolby 3D and Dolby 2D).

I have to say, the IMAX 3D presentation was absolutely stellar. The massive screen size (I watched it at the Brenden Palms 14 IMAX in Vegas) and the 3D really made you feel you were in the middle of the action. The Dolby 3D was great too, but I feel the IMAX 3D presentation was far superior as the Dolby did not feel as immersive (I watched the Dolby version at the AMC Burbank). Finally, and I can't believe I am saying this (as I prefer 2D to 3D), the Dolby 2D was a massive letdown - not because of the presentation (the Dolby projection and Atmos were amazing as always). But this movie is meant to be watched in 3D (and that too in **IMAX 3D**).

If you have not watched it yet, do yourself a favor and just watch it at an IMAX theater. The massive screen size will ensure that the image stretches all the way across your peripheral vision, thus making it super immersive.

I might have to go and watch it in IMAX 3D one more time (maybe next week). What a fun movie!",1672766976.0

He's smart but he has no respect on Na'vi that he manipulates just for himself, he might be a businessman but at expense of Pandora.  He created TAP just for Pandora's resources without financial expense as he hoped RDA with Na'vi diplomats.

What went wrong, let's find out-

\->! He lead a genocidal attack on the Sarentu clan by eradicating just to abduct their children, Manipulated Cortez to massacred the clan 'for the children' to train them as soldiers with TAP- where is he's too primitive to understand the 'greater good' claims. I have bone bone to pick with Harding as he tell her RDA will never know as she was involved with massacre. !<

\- His integrating Na'vi children into RDA is utter crap- brutal training \[broke Nor's finger\], severe psychological manipulation on poor Teylan \[poor cinnamon roll too pure for Pandora that needs protected at all cost with his I want to stop fighting dilema\], dehumanizing by >!treating them like animals in cages and clean them with disinfections. No wonder Sarentu player seek revenge because he screwed up her life by murder her clan and kidnapped her.!< 

\-He verbally and physically abuse by lying about being abandoned by their own clan and confiscating Sarentu's mother songcord to beating Teylan for wetting his bed that took weeks to heal. 

\-He murder Aha'ri in cold-blood when she escape, where is Alma when that happened. He has some heat with her as he punish entire group after she touched him.

\-utilizing military assets as he thinks Pandora is savage.

\- he lead region-wide oil extraction at entirety of Pandora's western ecosystem and the Na'vi tribes by run a large-scale fracking at cost of Western Frontier.

Exposition-commander explains it to scientist-character with the line ""And that's what pays for *all* this"". It will have a physiological effect (cure cancer, increase intelligence, or induce empathy/love) - it is *not* spice and it is not called ""spice""! There are giant creatures that live under the sand - that are *not* sandworms and are not called ""sandworms""! The red na'vi are able to ""swim"" through the sand, and will describe our protagonist as a ""baby/infant"" when first learning it.

[Cameron has spent years developing a new mocap technology to film actoring swimming though sand. Denis Villeneuve will ecstatically claim it will ""revolutionarize under-sand cinematography"".]

The sequence lifted from *Lawrence of Arabia* for this sequel will be... the well and ""Anvil of the Sun"", and a paraphrase like *""'The desert is an ocean in which no oar is dipped' and on this ocean the Na'vi go where they please and strike where they please.""*

The astronomical event is... night. Pandora, as seen so far, is one-face to its sun, so the only darkness is eclipse by the gas giant it orbits. But it is not quite one-face, and slowly turns, creating very long ""days"" and ""nights"" - earth-decades long. Night falls. The desert freezes and new creatures emerge - that are *not* white walkers and are not called ""white walkers"". The Na'vi are surprised at the surprise of the humans.

After my first (out of many) viewings, I actually did delude myself into thinking the movie was perfect. But the more I've seen it, and the more I've thought about it, more and more of its problems and flaws arose.

But it's still my favorite movie. No movie is perfect (or as cinemasins would say ""no movie is without sins""). And sure, some of my other favorite movies are technically more original and technically less flawed.

But Avatar is the movie that gave me the the most feels. You have no idea how much I empathize with Jake. It's actually kind of spooky how much of myself I see in him. Sure, my problems are mental (and I won't get into them here) rather than physical, but I could not help thinking he's basically me. Which is why I envied him and the way things turned out for him. 

When I left the cinema (lol remember cinemas?) after watching it for the first time, the line the resonated with me most was ""Everything is backwards now, like out there is the true world and this is the dream.""

By ""out there"" I mean the real world. ""This"" is the movie. Because I knew my life would never get better like it did for Jake. It was like seeing an alternate reality version of myself actually getting it together the way I never could. 

I went to see the movie again immediately the day after, and when that scene came up again I nearly cried. When I left the cinema that second time, I was heartbroken. In a way I kind of hate this movie for making me think someone like Jake (and in turn someone like me) had hope for the future. Hope that still hadn't realized, and likely never will.",1609332649.0
This Diehard Fan‚Äôs Thoughts on TWOW So Far,69,zocn46,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zocn46/this_diehard_fans_thoughts_on_twow_so_far/,20,"
- This movie is gorgeous, this we all know. I have ADHD and can‚Äôt sit still to save my life, yet I barely fidgeted through the 3-hour runtime.
- Going in with the understanding that we‚Äôre now in full franchise mode makes this movie easier to follow and allowed me to sit comfortably with unfinished/not fully fleshed out story lines knowing that they‚Äôll be continued soon. 
- Since it‚Äôs sci-fi, I decided before release that I‚Äôd go with the flow in regards to Quaritch, Kiri, and language.
- Jake has so much more to lose in this movie. I could feel his anguish as he was proposing leaving the People to Neytiri. Making the choice to leave, giving up so much to protect his family is the heart of this movie.
- The kids were all fantastic. Being a typical middle child, married to a ‚Äúperfect son‚Äù oldest child, I could really empathize with Lo‚Äôak and his relationship with Neteyam; the love and the desire to be seen as you really are outside of someone‚Äôs shadow.
- I was surprised by how interested I am in Quaritch now. There‚Äôs a lot to be fleshed out there.
- The similarities between Jake and Quaritch were particularly interesting to me. Two examples that stood out to me: Their shared use of the word ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù, when faced with a difficult task (Blue Unit being test dummies for combating Pandora‚Äôs immune response in the mountains/Jake about to choose his banshee). Their similar scenes with their banshees over their shoulders bearing their teeth when needing to convey their strength and resolve (Quaritch commandeering the whaling vessel/Jake returning to the People with Toruk). 
- I predict very interesting character development for Quaritch. He yielded killing the Tsah√¨k and burned the Metkayina village instead, he wanted his son to go with him in the end and the biggest event for me was his bonding with an ikran. I think he will begin to feel the Na‚Äôvi pull to the moon and the pull to Eywa; to respect the moon and all of its living beings. I could see him railing against that inner nature now that he is an Avatar, and absolutely hating how drawn he is to those feelings/urges/things. Will he be the villain to Jake this whole time? Or to the RDA? 
- James Cameron is a devout environmentalist and has said many times over that these movies have a very clear message; protect the planet. I cherish this message and admire his unyielding loyalty to his values.
- One of my main disappointments was with the soundtrack. For me, it was generic and forgettable with the only exceptions being excerpts from the OST. Avatar has a glorious soundtrack layered with different and unique instruments which all conveyed the tribal beauty of Pandora. I missed that greatly. I didn‚Äôt feel that there was the same emotional accompanying music that was poignant and memorable.
- My last big disappointment, which was due to my own hope and imagination, was not seeing Neytiri choose her new ikran. Personally, I always bond with creatures in movies over humans/humanoids. I adore Neytiri and have admired her since 2009, and I wanted to see her tackle this same ferocious task that we got to see Jake take on in Avatar.
- I do feel that we didn‚Äôt see enough of Neytiri, but I think that will change as the movies continue, this one was truly about the kids. In the end when I saw her heart rend further when he father‚Äôs bow was broken, I felt that this movie could have been redubbed as Neytiri Can‚Äôt Catch A Break. Our girl needs to win in a big way in the next movie. 
- Her rage was awe-inspiring, vicious, and truly frightening. Watching her fire an arrow through one of her victims and break necks with her bow? Wow. 
- Ronal and Tonowari were incredible and I can‚Äôt wait to see more of them
- I want an ilu",1671301763.0

I took 3 tabs and I gotta say, that was the most phenomenal experience of my entire life.

Well I was on Spotify when I realized that the soundtrack for this movie is probably available. So I searched it up and sure enough an album came up from the movie.

First song I put on was ‚ÄúThe bioluminescence of the night‚Äù. I remember this song playing when Jake first meets Neytiri and this scene walking through the glow in the dark jungle was really something else on acid.

Avatar remastered and post movie depression syndrome,37,xughsf,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/xughsf/avatar_remastered_and_post_movie_depression/,28,"Hi everyone, hope you're doing great. 

I'm not really a Reddit rat, to say the truth, it's the first time ever I'm posting on a forum but there's something I really want to share, to get out of my mind, and **I look forward to reading your comments**. 

Before starting, I would like to say that I really love my life, my work and that I have been blessed with the most awesome girlfriend ever.  

I would describe myself as a rather sensitive individual. I often get emotional after dealing with emotion loaded material (movies, video games, even videos of stray dogs rescue). For example, I couldn't help my self but be emotional when watching ""Bridging the Rift"", the Arcane Making-of. 

I guess I empathize with the charachters I interact with in such a way that what they live and/or feel and/or stand for really gets to me. 

Sometimes, this feeling fades away quickly after I'm done watching the movie, or playing the game. It remains as a nice memory, but nothing more. Sometimes though, it gets to an all other level. 

In fact, after interacting with a book/movie/game that I really loved and which I was really implied with, I get a really deep, mixed up and blurry feeling I have trouble putting words on, but I'll try to explain it the best I can. 

When it happens, I'm definitly sad. Sad to leave characters I deeply emotionally bounded with behind, sad to leave a world I loved so much and kinda sad to be back to reallity to be honest. At the same time, I have some deep intense feeling of joy to have been able to live what I lived when interacting with the movie/book/video game, all these incredibly powerfull emotions and I know that these memories I will be remembering forever. 

All in all, its almost like I'm split between sadness and joy, between emptiness and plenitude, and I just wish that I could forget it all and go through it for the first time again. 

This may happen wether the movie/game/book I interacted with is happy or sad, wether I could want to live what the characters lived or not (sometimes, they go through real tough shit). 

Every time this happens, I feel like I develop some kind of obsession for the book/movie/game I just played. I search the internet for all the related content I can find, trying to fill the hole, trying to forget that my life feels a bit dull in comparison. If it was after seeing a movie, I can't think about anything else than going back to the theater to watch it again. 

I also feel a bit disconnected from my friends / family / GF because I know that they don't relate to what I'm experiencing (for having asked them in the past already).  

After a couple of days/weeks in the worse cases, the feeling eventually fades away and every thing goes back to normal. 

As far as I can remember, it occured the first time after watching The edge of Tomorrow in the theater. 

Before this weekend, my last very bad case of this was after finishing The last of us pt. II, which left me completely devastated and emotionnaly exhausted (even to this date, I cannot listen to the otherwise fantastic soundtrack of this game whithout having to deal with an emotional tsunami). 

This Saturday night, I saw Avatar remastered in the theater (after having seen it back in 2009) and I have to admit that I currently experience a pretty ""bad"" case of this post movie depression syndrome I just described. The movie was trully amazing and left a real hole in me. 

It's not related to me wating to leave as a Na'vi on a Padora kind of exoplanet because, honestly, I love earth and my life here and even if our world is not perfect, I'm willing to do everything I can to make the life of my loved ones the most beautiful possible. 

I think it rather has to do with how deep I bounded emotionnaly with the characters, with this Na'vi people that seem so pure and kindhearted, with Jake, his past story and his journey to become one of the people, with Neytiri, which embodies strength, grace and willpower and with all the others... 

As always, I've developed some kind of obsession with this world, searching the internet and consuming any related content I can find (I've already ordered the extended blue-ray version and plan to go back to the theater as soon as possible). 

It has come to a point where my mind struggles focusing on something else, where all these emotions, these feelings, just feel to much, even though I'm so gratefull to have been able to exeperience all this... 

I hope that I've been able to explain this to you in the most understandable way and I would **LOVE** if you guys could answer with your own experience if it so happens that you lived something similar with Avatar or any other book/movie/video game. 

Thank you for reading ! 

Ps : sorry for my bad english :)",1664795512.0
Why do humans fall so easily against the Na'vi?,38,1atkfr2,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/1atkfr2/why_do_humans_fall_so_easily_against_the_navi/,26,"Humanity of the 22nd century. Extremely technologically advanced, with the capacity for interstellar flight, with weapons capable of pulverizing entire continents, with its extreme intelligence. How the hell is it possible that they are defeated SO easily by beings who are barely in the stone age? I understand that they have Eywa and her superior physical abilities but it's still too ridiculous

What kind of cheap technology does the RDA have? 

They do not have adequately armored glass for their helicopters or visors for their machines.

They do not have adequate armor or cover and sometimes it is as if they will intentionally allow themselves to be killed by the Na'vi.

It's like they haven't learned anything at all since they were kicked out of Pandora in the first movie. They did not learn new tactics, they did not bring better technology and weapons. Etc



(By the way. I do not empathize in any way with the RDA)",1708226820.0
Kiri's Journey,26,w64b1z,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/w64b1z/kiris_journey/,2,"I've speculated Spider will go to Earth, my second speculation is Kiri will live on Bridgehead.

My thinking is this, I see her as a Woodspirte which is a seed of the great tree. She's described as not being prepossessing and the only weapon we see her with is a dagger, not a bow meaning she's not a hunter like Neytiri, a proud warrior princess that Kiri is described as not feeling like she can measure up to. I think Kiri is the total opposite of Neytiri, like a woodsprite, completely harmless and going acquiescently wherever fate takes her.

Like a woodsprite, she'll be as silent as one /u/Neutral0814 has theorized that Kiri will be mute and I think they're are bang on the money. (https://redd.it/vs6o5n) They referenced the fact that Cameron hired, CJ Jones, a deaf man to create a sign language for the sequels (One that'd suit a four fingered people). If it was just for underwater communication, you do not need a complex language for that, Cameron being a diver himself could easily come up with the basic gestures for temporary underwater communication. Being Mute would bypass the obstacle of Sigourney Weaver's mature voice and it explains why she's silent in all the shots we've seen her. Her body language seems to center around touch and observation, tells of someone who can't use speech to express. And we know Cameron is not afraid to write disabled heros.

So what better place for a seed of Eywa then a place where there is no Eywa: the greenless world of the RDA base. In an early draft of the first Avatar movie, Neytiri was a captive trapped on Hell's Gate, suppose this situation plays out instead with Kiri? In the fourth slated movie, Kiri will be about 20 (There'll be a 6 year time jump and she's roughly 13-14 in Way of Water) What could be more tragic for Jake and Neytiri then to see their daughter taken captive by the enemy? There's a possibility that here, she'll repeat the life of Grace Augustine by serving as a teacher to perhaps other na'vi captives and any children born to the recombinants. And It's here she'll repeat her mother's journey and fall in love with a sky person,

Miles Quaritch.

Think about it, Jake learned to love Pandora by seeing it through the eyes of Neytiri. Through whose eyes will Miles see it? What would be more complicated, more messy and more Cameron'esque then to see a Romeo and Juliet story between the reincarnations of Grace and Quaritch? Things have been flipped on their head, Grace who was a mother to Jake is now being raised as his daughter. Quaritch was like a father, so likewise this role too, will be flipped; what once was hatred will be reborn as love. For a character who always has their guard up like Quaritch,  you set him next to one that's completely harmless to the point where they need someone to look after them, (And if she's mute, she's helpless without someone who can also sign.) This might be the one thing that breaks through Miles tough exterior and cause him to progress as a character by looking out for Kiri. It doesn't hurt she's the most human looking na'vi and doesn't use a bow and arrow (That's a must on his Tinder profile). Added that it's been alluded by Stephen Lang that you don't get shot by two arrows and not be affected by it, it's quite possible his character will suffer from ghost pain and will need support when those attacks come on. Jake would also learn first hand in the most painful way possible what betrayal  feels like when one of your own falls in love with the enemy... 

If this does happen, then Miles (And Kiri just the feminine version) will be like the Jake Sully for the RDA, a hero whose cause you can empathize with. If things go in this direction and she and Miles do become a mated pair, then when he and Jake do battle, your heart will be torn in two. You'll want neither side to win or lose but rather they lay down arms and come to peace; just as you want to see that between the sky people and na'vi. 

...if either side can let go of their blind hatred.",1658583664.0
And Spider's father is...,19,wc2u72,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/wc2u72/and_spiders_father_is/,17,"Alright so there's some discussion as to whose Spider's parents are. All we know of him is that he was abandoned on Hell's Gate because he was deemed too weak to return  (Or orphaned, I've been hearing this theory as well. It's too early to tell.) Being a human on Pandora is enough reason for Jake to pity Spider but if Spider was considered a weak and therefor abandoned child, a paraplegic marine who was sick and tired of doctors telling him what he couldn't do would have an added reason to empathize with the babies plight. Now Jake is his adopted father but we know he couldn't possibly be the real one for... reasons.

Now Miles Quaritch was considered due to the whole debacle of Spider's real name being Miles. As I heard one individual point out, they guy's too busy killing the wildlife to have time for getting it on. Story wise I can't see this reveal adding anything to the plot other than a cheap 'le gasp' moment, unless further reasons are given.

But who would have time for that sort of thing? What sort of thing are privileged corporate shirt's known to do? Use their authority to sleep with a subordinate. My sister said it first and I think she's onto something, the dad's in fact Parker Selfridge.

Now I've theorized that Selfridge is going to be the real big bad of the next movies, that he's since climbed the ranks of the RDA empire for successfully removing the Omaticaya from their Unobtainium gold mine and gotten top position for it. That it was through Selfridge that the RDA developed the gusto to go and take back that prize with a military and tech that's more advanced than ever.

Now what would this guy do upon learning that his only son is back on Pandora and being raised by his worst enemy? What would Sully do knowing that by holding onto Spider he's denying him a promised life of prosperity back on Earth? Realistically, Spider is under constant threat by Pandora's toxic atmosphere, if the battery pack dies on his breathing mask or if anything damages it, he's toast. Now Spider is going to be getting an avatar body (Thanks to /u/DiscoveringPandora for pointing out the evidence) I think it's Jake that's behind this arrangement. That he's shooting for a permanent consciousness transfer for Spider like his old man. But I think it's going to south and Spider will realize that his destiny lies in going back home and dawning the grey suit.

Now if Spider does take over the RDA empire, he could transform it's directive into using Pandora to terraform Earth. That if Spider makes that kind of sacrifice to go home, he could end up saving not only the Na'vi but humanity itself. Whoah that's quite the destiny...

Now other sources say his name is Javier (A name that sounds like saviour) Soccoro. Javier is derived of Xavier, a Christian missionary who travelled great distances (The name Miles implies that too) and Soccoro is Spanish for ‚ÄúSuccour and Help‚Äù So Spider's name implies going a great distance to provide aid.

I think our teenaged monkey boy here might become the biggest game changer of all Sully's kids.",1659202424.0
Does Spider have Stockholm Syndrome?,14,1569qzv,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/1569qzv/does_spider_have_stockholm_syndrome/,19,"Stockholm Syndrome is the psychological condition of a victim who identifies with and empathizes with their captor or abuser and their goals. However, isn't a psychological diagnosis. And most people don't believe it.

Now Spider has been stuck with this version of his father, Quaritch for a few months. Over time, the two formed a father-son relationship. They both care for each other. However, things start to divide when Quaritch starts burning down villages, aiding in hunting Tulken, and capturing his friends is when Spider starts to despise him a bit. Later, Spider begs him not to hurt Kiri, even under knifepoint. While Spider knew all this was to save Kiri, it was still a scary situation because Spider knows Neytiri hates him. Then Quaritch saved Spider from Neytiri. Last but not least, Spider thought he found Jake's body in the sinking ship but it was Quaritch. Spider was going to leave to drown but changed his mind at the last second and drags him out of the ocean. Dispute everything he's been through for the last few months, Spider went back to the Sully family.

Now go back to his past. During his childhood, Spider was in the care of his foster family, The McCosters, and the scientists. As a kid, Spider loved to play in the forest but the McCosters weren't a fan of it. Spider only started hanging in the forest more when he meets the Sully family. He grows a strong bond with the Sully kids, most importantly with Kiri. While he is friends with the kids, he doesn't have a parental relationship with any adult in his life. All he has is a photo of his mom and knowledge of what his crazy father did. Jake views him as a stray cat while Neytiri views him as a son demon that needs to be with his kind. From the looks of it, Spider has been taking care of himself most of his life.

I'm no psychologist but it seems to me that Spider desire for a parental relationship, to be loved, to be seen, someone who will listen to him, someone who will take care of him for once. I believe he may saw this in the Recom of his father. If only wasn't so damn evil.

Spider's character is most interesting to me, he's complex, and he has internal conflict. I don't think he deserves all the hate his character gets. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Why is Kiri considered Mute?,73,wrlxi2,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/wrlxi2/why_is_kiri_considered_mute/,24,"I'm hearing people talk how this theory is being taken as cannon and wondering why. So my sister and I have been compiling together all the reasons why we think Kiri is most likely mute to clear things up.

**Outside Confirmations**

+ CJ Jones, a deaf actor was [hired to create a na'vi sign language.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/122993065/avatar-hire-renowned-deaf-actor-cj-jones-to-create-sign-language) It'd also have to accommodate a four-fingered peoples. There's been speculation Cameron intended this solely for underwater communication however all Cameron said was,

>‚ÄúWe did a scene last week with six teenagers, well, actually five teenagers and one 7-year-old underwater holding their breath for a couple minutes and acting, actually doing a dialogue scene under water because they speak kind of a sign language.‚Äù

He didn't outright say signing underwater was why he had it created. Cameron is a certified diver himself, he can easily come up with his own na'vi hand signs for inherently short dialogues underwater. Instead he commissioned the help of a deaf actor to come up with a brand new sign language with it's own syntax. If the signing is for diving, you ask a diver. If signing is for a disabled character, you ask a disabled actor.
CJ Jones is cast to play in the new movies but he's [not allowed to say who he's playing](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi4dDK4nds2/?hl=en). Why not? If it's to be the Metikayina translator which the IMDB assumes, what's the thinking? Why be tight-lipped about it? What better place to hide the secret that one of your leads is mute than putting the actor's coach in plain sight.

+ Sigourney Weaver, when asked about her role of Kiri, said she had to [learn how to act in a completely new way](https://mobile.twitter.com/avatarsequelsbr/status/1545892190106394625). She's playing a teenager but Sigourney doesn't need to learn how to act like a teen, she was one once; if anything she'd need a refresher as it's been fifty years. If she's playing a mute, then she'd need an acting coach on not only how to sign, but how to act with sign. In Guillermo del Toro 2017 'Shape of Water' Sally Hawkins plays Elisa, a mute woman. 

>‚ÄúTo make sure Hawkins got it right, the production hired two ASL coaches, one of whom was Amanda Richer, an actress, director, and producer.‚Äù

Hawkins had to train for months under Richer so she could play a convincing ASL signer. 
Not only does ‚ÄúThe Shape of Water sound similar to ‚ÄúThe Way of Water‚Äù, but Guillermo del Toro happens to be one of James Cameron's close personal friends; and buddy story-tellers love to bounce ideas off one another.

**Technical Reasons**

The voice issue. If Kiri is playing a na'vi teen on the cusp of adulthood, but played by a woman in her seventies, there are three options going forward if Kiri does speak.


+ Sigourney uses her own voice. There'd be a disconnect registering Kiri as young if her voice is old. Sigourney could do a voice but she's not a voice actress and for the roles she has lent her voice to, the range is much the same as her regular speaking voice. She always sounds like Sigourney, a woman who captures your attention through the authority in her tone. 

+ They modulate her voice. This might work for a speaking line or two but for four movies it'd get very old very quick. It'd alienate the audience from an already alien character.

+ The dub. Dubs have the disadvantage of vocal dissonance from the actors' performance, it can be done and done well but it's not ideal especially for a blockbuster saga. On top of that, no actress is listed as playing her voice. Maybe they're keeping it secret, okay why? They're not secretive about Kiri being played by Sigourney, so what's there to hide about a dub to bypass the voice issue? 

**Story Related Reasons**

+ Kiri is described as not being **prepossessing**; *impressive to others, esp. Immediately.* Sigourney's voice is impressive to others; the only way I see her playing the realistic role of a wallflower is if she talks little or not at all.

+ Kiri is also trying to find out who she is. If she doesn't know who she is then she doesn't know her own voice. This could be played up on a literal level.

+ If Kiri is mute, she'd have an affinity for being underwater for this would be the one world where everyone is rendered like her: unable to talk.

+ Jake's kids would already have to know sign in order to talk underwater with the Metkayina kids. So na'vi sign is universal for the same reason their speaking tongue is. The Metkayina have reason to use it more frequently than the Omaticaya yet it sounds like Jake's kids are well-versed in it already.

+ Kiri's movements and appearance is much like a woodsprite, or as the na'vi call it, 'Atokirina' A-T-O-**K-I-R-I**-N-A. Her connections to Eywa are already irrefutable but her physical similarities to the seeds of Eywa can't go ignored. Woodsprites are *silent*, harmless, pure spirits of the forest. So unassuming yet the moment one catches your eye it commands your attention, because how could you not be in awe for something so ethereal? Kiri, if she signs, will command the attention of the whole audience as they try and figure out what she's trying to say, just as the na'vi try to figure out what the Atokirina's are saying.

+ In a [shot of her with her family](https://ibb.co/fSxhDmP), she's touching Neteyam's back despite him being injured. In another [shot of Lo'ak looking up into the sky](https://ibb.co/YNbf85V) there's a head in the bottom right corner; the facial stripes and headband match Neytiri's but there's a set of hands rubbing her head. Those hands are small, feminine and five-fingered; consider they'd have to belong to someone with a close connection to Neytiri to deign such touch, then only Kiri qualifies.
In deaf/mute culture, on top of sign, people communicate through feels/touch: expressing themselves via tactile input in lieu of speaking. Only a family inured to feels/touch would not be unsettled by this strange behaviour, which to the deaf/mute is not strange at all but completely natural.

+ If she's a personification/extension of Eywa, well Eywa doesn't talk. Secondly the na'vi mantra is *To See*. The only way you can understand Kiri is if you *see her* just as the na'vi people see into Pandora. Being mute would showcase the symbolic meaning of this mantra on a tangible level.

+ Feels/touch would be normal to the Sully's but it'd be completely unsettling to anyone outside of the na'vi understanding. I'm referring to the recoms, specifically Quartich. Quaritch will be unnerved by Kiri just as Jake was by the woodsprites. (Jake even whacked one in a jerk reaction). Their shared marine training has/will fail to prepare them for something so harmless and so unassuming as a woodsprite; something that you don't realize until it's too late just how powerless you are to it's affect on you.
Direct quote from Stephen Lang regarding Quaritch in the upcoming movies.
> The world begins to ‚Äì the world of Pandora ‚Äì begins to affect him quite deeply in ways that he either refused or it did not affect him. And it gets under his skin.‚Äù

If Kiri represents Pandora, then she's going to get under his skin. She'll be the deadliest thing he ever encountered because this anthropomorphic woodsprite has the power to make him soft. And that'll bug the hell out of him.

**Personal Reasons**

+ Cameron's not afraid to write disabled heros. Jake Sully was a paraplegic. 

+ Now I'm going to insert myself and say that deaf/mute culture is a fascinating world that rewards anyone who goes out of their way to learn about it. For an inquisitive, empathetic soul like Cameron I don't see him being indifferent to the world of signing. Rather he'd showcase it in his work when given the chance. He sees beauty all around him and what better place to show it than this mangum opus that is his Avatar saga?",1660835172.0

We need to talk about nuances,23,znduhd,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/znduhd/we_need_to_talk_about_nuances/,6,"ETA: English is not my first language, but I tried my best


I've seen some posts complaining about how humanity is depicted in TWOW, and others complaining about some specific characters behaviour that showcase their full humanity.

This will talk in detail about plot details of the movie, so full spoiler warning. You've been warned, read at your own risk.


---------------------------

A quick premise: the critique posed in both movies is not a critique of humanity as a whole, rather a critique of certain types of individuals, with a not-so-subtle focus on the military and corporations as a whole. 
Humans were allowed to stay on the planet not because they're Jake's friend, but because they were humans who cared about the Planet and the Na'vi. Humans even Neytiri somehow trusted, or at the very least tolerated.

Keeping that in mind, let's start. A few characters were used to drive some specific points, and I think we should talk about that.


Spider

I think Spider is the best character to talk about when we talk about humanity. He's a kid who grew up with scientists and with Na'vi, creating a peculiar mix.
We discover pretty quickly that he's always known the truth about his father, but we don't know if he ever told Jake about it. Neytiri knows by the end, but we don't know if she was just assuming. He's fully aware of who his father is, what he's done and, even though he does get closer to him, he never falls into the trap and he's always able to remember that Quarritch is not a good person. So much that he loudly and proudly denies to ever use the name Miles.

I've read a few critiques here and there about how he saved Quarritch and then just went back to Jake. The thing these critiques fail to recognise, in my opinion, is that Spider is a child. A child who rarely witnessed death in any way other than the normal cycle of life. The first time he comes in contact with violent death is by the hands of his own father, with the Metkayina village and then with Neteyam, his life long friend.
When he sees Quarritch lying there, almost dead, he's grieving both the deaths of people he loved and the betrayal of his own father.
He doesn't want to be like his father. He doesn't want to be a killer. So he saves him, but he never wants to be next to him. He saves him because it's his nature and his compassion as a human being. He doesn't want to have Quarritch's blood on his hands, but at the same time he knows he doesn't deserve to live.

But Spider is not Jake, who has been trained to kill with a cold mind. He's a child who is just now grasping the nuances of life and the lack of black and white.


Jake

Going with the flow, Jake proves to be the human he was 15 years prior with one simple action: he makes a mistake. And a big one that is.
He tries to protect his family, but the only way he knows how to do it is by being a soldier. Soldiers and armies need discipline and the blind following of orders to work seamlessly. That's why when his kids defy those orders he screws up. That's when the human, the father, the man who would prefer to be skinned alive rather than see his children suffer, shows through the cracks. When normal human children disobey, they might break a few bones, but they will most likely be fine.
When Jake's children disobey, they die. That's shown many times in the movie: when they bomb the train and Neteyam gets hit, when they go to the battle ground and they fall into Quarritch's hands, and at the end when Neteyam dies because Lo'ak wanted to go into battle. 
A father protects, that's what gives him a meaning, that's what Jake says. The only way he knows how to protect his children is by being strict, Soldier like.

But that doesn't come free. His children love him, but can't understand why he's the way he is. Lo'ak understands only when Neteyam dies and he sees the consequences of his actions. 
At the same time Jake realises how badly he screwed up when the child he just called a disappointment in the middle of grief grows up and matures in front of his eyes.

Was Jake right in rasing his children that way? Absolutely no. But Jake is the other face of Quarritch's medal. He might be more empathetic, but he'll always suffer from the blind one-way thinking of soldiers. We also don't know much about his family, but everything we're shown since the first movie points to him not having any family except his twin.


Quarritch

Recom Quarritch is an interesting character. He is still the big bad guy he was as a human, but we see for the first time his more caring side. He has a son, his ""flesh and blood"", he can't help but care about him (and shows it by breaking his mask when Neytiri hurts Spider), but at the same time, he's still the power thirsty guy he was when he was alive.

He searches for Jake instead of going after the clans. Why? It's explained as soon as we meet him for the first time: revenge.
He wants to destroy Jake and his family because they killed him and they made a fool of him.
Killing Jake is useful for a series of reasons: 
1. It's easier to destroy the will of a group of rebels by killing the head, who happens to be the only Na'vi who is able to accurately predict human's strategies
2. The Recoms need to be tested. You don't bring them on a massive operation until you're 100% sure you'll be able to control them.
So they give him a solo mission to check how he acts, how loyal he is, etc. He doesn't have the RDA ships and weapons. He needs to basically steal someone else's ship and sailors and make it work. It's very likely that it's also a way to keep the entire operation quiet.

He's not a black and white character, he's not following orders anymore. He wants Jake dead, and it's his own anger that drives him. I'm sure that if the RDA shut down the operation he would still go on alone and with his bare hands.


Humans are not all good or all bad. Some of them are both. Some of them have good feelings, but make bad choices. Others have bad intentions, but still keep some good feelings.
We can relate to Spider not being able to kill his own father, even though his father severely hurt him and other people. 
We can relate to Jake trying his best to protect his family, but royally screwing up because he has no one to support and guide him.
And if we can't relate to Quarritch we know at least one individual who sees others as inferior, but still loves his family (as long as the family behaves exactly like him)


The same observations can and should be made on the Na'vi who are anything but the ""good guys"", but I think that deserves its own post",1671194721.0
"Theory/prediction on Avatar 3: Eywa is trying to save Earth, The fire Na'vi and the seed",15,zr2bqe,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zr2bqe/theoryprediction_on_avatar_3_eywa_is_trying_to/,3,"So we know from past interviews that future movies will try to play around with the idea of bad or at least more morally grey Na'vi factions and we also know that the title of the next movie is ""The Seed Bearer"". Since in the first film Grace died and is now with Eywa, it is safe to assume that she has full access to Grace's memories. Through them she can see the absolute state in which Earth is and grows empathetic, maybe not necessarily of the suffering of the human race, but of that of the planet itself, its flora and fauna and decides to try and help Earth. Maybe by planting the seed of a Pandoran tree infused with life essence from Eywa herself on Earth, it can basically terraform (or maybe pandoform?) the Earth, thus saving it but at the cost of all life on it now being a weird mishmash between Earthly and Pandoran life. This would be a much more peaceful way of saving Earth than terraforming the entire planet of Pandora, so Jake and the gang would be ok with giving the seed to the humans so they can take it and save their planet. Perhaps even the Metkayina could see that even though the humans have done a lot of harm, no one would have anything to lose from saving their planet so they decide to help as well. This is where the ""bad"" Na'vi come into play, presumably the fire or ""ash people"" Na'vi that I've seen mentioned in another post about an interview. These could be a faction that got wronged by the humans in a big way, an equivalent to the destruction of Home Tree in their culture. As such, they are not very fond of humans and the idea of helping their home planet in any way shape or form, so they try to stop the seed from reaching the humans. This could lead to a fight where the Sullys, the Metkayina and even the humans team up to fight the volcano people. In order for the volcano Na'vis to stand as a particularly intimidating opponent they could be a lot larger and more physically imposing, with tough skin adapted to life in very hot environments giving them an edge in combat. Also the animals they ride could be a lot more dangerous and deadly since they too would be adapted to the extreme life of volcanic biomes.",1671576675.0
Theory for possible climax of last film.,14,w3qt4l,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/w3qt4l/theory_for_possible_climax_of_last_film/,6,"I was wondering what would be the climax of the final movie (The quest for Eywa); it'd have to be something big, something that'd top everything prior; the highest stakes, all the marbles kind of thing. And above all, something that'd cause all sides to come together (mostly).

So what would that be? What would threaten everyone alike? Well, the destruction of Pandora; more specifically, her ecosystem. (Like a triggered volcanic eruption on a huge enough scale that could damage air quality to the point of choking out most life)The RDA's end goal is to mine it's minerals, it's fauna is an obstacle that's cost them billions but if Pandora were a dead world then the RDA can mine in peace since the humans already can and do survive independently of the world. I'm thinking that the real big bad of this story has promoted a way to blot out life on Pandora, someone who doesn't care who is sacrificed to obtain their end goal and that's not even the survival of Earth but pure self interest.

Which comes to my second theory, the big bad will be Selfridge. In this story you can't be a fence sitter, you're either for helping Pandora or letting her burn. That last look Selfridge gave Jake screamed 'It's not over yet.' The actor is slated for all four movies and I don't think he's coming back a tree hugger. That this not entirely evil, almost empathetic corporate shirt‚Äîin his wounded pride and chagrin‚Äîwill embody the irredeemable, psychopathic selfishness of big business. Remember, like Selfridge, the RDA didn't start out with malicious intent but that's changed and so will he. It would be an ironic twist that the first movies villains would reverse roles and Selfridge would become a heartless force that'd unnerve even Quaritch.

And this comes to my third theory, what would be the solution? I've a feeling it's Kiri, I've suggested it before that's she's an embodiment of Eywa, an anthropomorphic woodsprite(seed of the great tree). But this would mean Eywa has gone quiet in the world to the unease of the na'vi. If Eywa is in her, she's destined to come out again. Through Kiri, Eywa will defeat this threat but it'll will require everyone to lay down arms and come together to make it happen.

This would mirror the first movie in some respects but instead of all the clans, it'll be all the forces.

Thoughts?

--EDIT after doing some thinking I don't think Eywa will leave Kiri because I think that would symbolize Eywa leaving Pandora, effectively destroying the planet.",1658334774.0
The global success of Avatar is symptomatic of our shared unconscious belief that we could all be living better and being more respectful of Nature.,7,i7w4lm,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/i7w4lm/the_global_success_of_avatar_is_symptomatic_of/,5,"I always saw people‚Äôs/the world‚Äôs universal resonance with [Avatar](https://www.avatar.com/explore/many-clans-one-heart) (to the point of it becoming #1 film in the world for almost 10 years) as a blend of **wonderment** (awe at Pandora itself), 

a subconscious sense of **pro-environmental conscience** (the awareness that we all need to be treating the planet better), 

but I think the third and biggest portion of that blend is is because it reminds of **how we we used to live** (Native Cultures),

and how in so many ways we *should* be living, for the benefit of everything: 

vastly improved physical/psychological/emotional health, 

a reconnection with spirituality (not religion, mind, but spirituality),

And a reintegration with Nature and her timeless lessons, living more empathetically with each other and towards the natural world (Flora/Fauna). 

I come from Australia, home of the oldest-recorded culture (over 10,000 years), 

and a central tenet of Aboriginal culture is the fundamental, life-long belief that the land (and everything within it) doesn‚Äôt belong to you, *you* belong to *it*. 

You‚Äôre a guest to this reality, 

and when you‚Äôre a guest somewhere, 

you (pardon the language) need to fucking behave, be polite, be gracious. In so many ways, we‚Äôre not doing that at all. 

In fact, many of us ‚Äòguests‚Äô get kicked out for misbehaving.

The Avatar films go beyond what Star Wars or Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings do ‚Äî they have a central message ‚Äî not an overly pushy one ‚Äî but a unified purpose *behind* the visual dazzlement, storytelling and lore, beyond just brand reinforcement and making money.

Entertainment and art are the single most powerful signal-boosters in our culture (a culture of storytellers, before we had schools or politics) - 

the walls come down when we‚Äôre at that proverbial campfire and, 

with our eyes wide beholding the lights and sounds, we become receptive to deeper lessons, there for us to notice and absorb, *if* we‚Äôre open to them.

The world needs Avatar‚Äôs lessons more than ever, 

Certain groups‚Äô rejection of the film is symptomatic in its own way,

of a sense of unconscious shame at what they‚Äôve been complicit in (promoting junk-food entertainment, doing nothing about the planet or to improve their lives), 

and their unwillingness for things to change for the better.

Like Eywa ‚Äòactivating‚Äô when the planet needed it most, I see the films as an extension of that. 

Maybe Pandora doesn‚Äôt exist, but I weirdly (and in a corny/sappy way, if you wanna call it that, I won‚Äôt stop you) see the folks making them as being these agents of her all-unifying will,

And the films as manifestations of what she, however far her eye is from us (or even if it exists), believes we all could benefit from ‚Äî 

the same energies that she used to make the world of Avatar itself, applied to creating these films, which will hopefully have their own cause-and-effect impact, 

Inspiring us all to live closer to the older, timeless ways.   

I for one think it‚Äôs absolutely possible ‚Äî but as Neytiri said, ‚Äòno one can teach you to see‚Äô.

You have to wake up yourself, on your own. 

You can‚Äôt be preached to or ‚Äòconverted‚Äô...the lesson needs to come from within. 

*You* need to have that awakening of conscience, on an individual level. 

And when enough people do that in a concentrated capacity ‚Äî perhaps subtly inspired by Lessons-cloaked-in-entertainment like Avatar ‚Äî 

Now that, that can seriously/potentially make a difference.",1597167303.0
Will the NAVIS have their own HUMAN AVATAR in Avatar 5?üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,5,1098q3i,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/1098q3i/will_the_navis_have_their_own_human_avatar_in/,1,"After the news that Avatar 5 will take place on earth, countless questions are brewing in our heads, such as: What is the reason for them going to earth? How will they breathe? Will the final battle be on earth instead of Pandora? Among many more unknowns. At the moment the possible answers are lucubrations devoid of concise information. However, we have a piece of information that could expose Cameron's intention to close the saga: HUMAN AVATARS. 

Cameron tells us that his goal is to open Neytiri's eyes, ""...not all humans are bad and not all Navis are good, and Neytiri needs to know that,"" says the film's producer. It seems that this change of perspective for the character will be developed in Avatar 3 with the appearance of the fire tribe known as ""The People of Ashes"", who will function as antagonists of it.

Now, back to the point of this post, would it be possible for Neytiri to discover human beauty through her own human Avatar as Jake did? The answer is yes, but it is not known how it would happen. What we do know is that an Avatar is created with the genetics of the person undergoing the consciousness transfer, and this is possible with the use of advanced pods. Perhaps the members of the GDR obtain the DNA of Neytiri and Kiri (according to leaks, the latter will be kidnapped) and with this, they create their Avatars. Because let's be honest, seeing beings over 2 meters tall with their striking blue color does not go unnoticed by human eyes or by any thinking being.

Neytiri accepting the kind and empathetic side of humanity will only be possible by living with those she currently considers her enemies. The warmth of a human family similar to Neytiri's may be the trigger for her change.

Let's see what Cameron doesn't have in store for 2024 with Avatar 3.

My thoughts and opinions on the second film!! (Spoilers obvs lol),4,zo6sym,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zo6sym/my_thoughts_and_opinions_on_the_second_film/,6,"I saw the movie yesterday and made a post about how utterly gorgeous it‚Äôs was! But I have a few things to mention.

1. Jake is a bit of a toxic dad. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I understand the amount of strict authority you‚Äôd need to ensure complete protection over your family in such horrific dangers, but as we see in The High Ground comics, Jake wasn‚Äôt ever too friendly to his boys long before the sky people returned. I mean, he has them calling him ‚ÄúSir‚Äù ? Like he‚Äôs some sort of corporate American leader. Pretty sure I heard his sons call Jake ‚ÄúSir‚Äù more than I ever heard ‚ÄúDad‚Äù  It‚Äôs weird, it‚Äôs not loving or fatherly, and I personally feel like it takes a lot away from who Jake was in the first film. I understand character development and environmental justification but it just felt.. off. Even Neytiri said ‚ÄúThis is not a squad, it‚Äôs a family‚Äù
And, not to mention his whole disregard for Lo‚Äôak, and my opinion on that comes from the scene where Lo‚Äôak saves Jake from drowning under the ship, and Jake mistakes him for Netayam. Shocking tbh, shows how little he thought of his youngest son?

2. Netayam‚Äôs death didn‚Äôt feel like much to the audience, in my opinion. Not counting The High Ground comics, the audience gets all of maybe an hour‚Äôs worth of footage in order to make any sort of bond with Netayam as a character, which is nowhere near enough. And I‚Äôm unsure whether that was purposeful? It just didn‚Äôt feel right, I had no connection to him in order to feel anymore than your average empathetic person during his death. Like I felt too much like an outsider? As we didn‚Äôt really get to know anything about him, I feel like he was killed off too quickly. But then again in the film, Jake implies that his sons death taught him not to run anymore. Idk, maybe I‚Äôm projecting too much but I thought we were meant to have been prefaced with more emotional attachment before that scene. 

3. I didn‚Äôt want to spoil the film for myself so I kept to watching trailers and public information only. But in my opinion, they leaked far too much. I pretty much knew the plot of the entire film, which I felt was unexpected. And it made the movie feel like only an hour long with fill-in scenes making up for the rest üò¨ or maybe that‚Äôs a bit harsh. You could also argue that‚Äôs on me for even being in these subs lolll

4. Quaritch going right back to hunting jake after waking up from the dead is kinda dumb. Like you don‚Äôt think for two moments this man might realise he has genuinely just died and that his life could be worth so much more than trying to shank some big blue marine? I just can‚Äôt imagine any personal quarrel being that huge. I‚Äôd of even liked just a small scene where Quaritch thought back on his life and his actions for two measly seconds. 

 
Despite these thoughts, I absolutely love this film, I‚Äôll be watching it again with friends in a few days time and I‚Äôm buying it when it‚Äôs released online lol. The entire movie was a master piece, and I love it so muchhhh.

Also please be kind if you make a comment, these are just thoughts on a fictional universe after all. I mean no harm lol thank you!",1671285400.0
Does anyone feel disappointed by the behaviour of the teenagers?,3,107s0ju,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/107s0ju/does_anyone_feel_disappointed_by_the_behaviour_of/,47,"I don‚Äôt buy it that Na‚Äôvi teenagers, from any tribe, would act like high school bullies from an American TV show. In the first movie we are shown that the Na‚Äôvi are extremely empathetic due to their spirituality and ability to literally feel the emotions of other people and animals through their queues. They are so unified in their respect for one another and every creature of Eywa. They even have an intense connection with their ancestors, who they pay respect to and remember at sites like the tree of voices. With such literal abilities to connect with the emotions of other life forms, and raised under such spiritual teachings, I do not believe that Na‚Äôvi teenagers would behave even remotely like human teenagers. In fact, in the first movie, the love and awe Kiri feels towards the planet are presented as the norm for Pandoran people. Through Neytiri, Jake learns about the tiny ‚Äúscents and sounds‚Äù that the Na‚Äôvi are aware of, the natural parts of their world that they appreciate in everything they do, and their instinctive kindness towards all living things. They contrast the humans in every way. However, in ‚ÄòThe Way of Water,‚Äô all this is forgotten. Kiri is painted as weird for appreciating nature and getting distracted by its beauty. The boys of the Metkayina tribe bully her over it. The only connection they seem to have with nature is through their tulkun ‚Äúsoul brothers/soul sisters.‚Äù Other than that, they act just like rowdy human teenagers with a love of the waves. They‚Äôre just malapert surfer boys. Believing in the ways of Eywa doesn‚Äôt require faith on Pandora. They feel her power and interact with others through her. I simply don‚Äôt believe that such a deeply emotionally and spiritually evolved species such as the Na‚Äôvi would behave exactly like human TV clich√©s as teenagers.

I‚Äôd like to be very clear that I am not under the belief that the Na‚Äôvi have no capacity for violence or ruthlessness. They are tribal warriors, after all. I just think that the cringeworthy stereotypical behaviour and talk of TV high school teens does not align with the culture of the Na‚Äôvi.",1673302791.0
"I loved it somehow, but I still am incredibly mad. I am downright offended.",3,zpou4z,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zpou4z/i_loved_it_somehow_but_i_still_am_incredibly_mad/,20,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it to a certain point. The three and a half hours went by so quickly and I shared tears, laughed and I think I looked like surprised pikachu for a considerable amount of time due to beautiful visuals. But I have to get this off my chest. There are so many more things I want to say but I'll stick to this for starters.

**The Whale being an outcast was a WRONG decision. It was NON-sensical.**

In the first movie they established that the Na'vi have real deep connection to all the animals and plants through Eywa, and even in this movie they showed multiple scenes where they'd show us that the Na'vi don't make a difference between them and their animal companions. \*They cry just as heartbroken.\*So why on earth, would these highly empathetic beings outcast such a highly sensitive being on ! THE ASSUMPTION ! that he killed a bunch of whales and Na'vi ALONE??? WHEN HE WAS A BABY? WHEN THEY LITERALLY HAD THE POSSIBILITY OF LOOKING INTO HIS MEMORIES?????!!!!!!  WHAT?

Sorry for that but whose Idea was this?Just like the scene where the oldest son kills a fish and everyone is like happy laughing. Excuse me? Are fish suddenly not a part of Eywa? If they have to hunt them for food, so be it, but I thought it was important to them to do so in a *respectful* manner? Like they felt the pain of taking a life and should pay their respects? Remember the first scene we get to meet Neytiri, when she had to kill that dog-thing to safe Jake? What happened to that f\*\*\*king simple concept?

Also the way they ""humanized"" the Na'vi was so out of place. Them saying ""Bro, Baby-Bro, Baby-Girl"" or the bullying being exactly as short minded as you would expect children in regular High Schools to be.... These are Na'vi, they shouldn't feel this mundane and stupid. I thought the point was that they, even though they were not perfect, were still wiser since they could connect to Eywa. Doesn't that mean anything anymore? It feels as is the movie picks and chooses when the folks are connected and wise, and when they suddenly act like foolish disconnected humans. Make it make sense.

The Na'vi are an alien species that are incredibly connected spiritually to their home planet and everything that lives on there. How dare you make them seem like they are just like us, just stoopid hoomans. Not even enlightened humans, but downright western society humans. Like, is this the only culture that you understand, Cameron? We didn't get to see their actual culture, the *actual* psychology of what a civilization like that would look like. And its not like he would have had to build that from scratch, since there are many native tribes and other cultures that he could've taken inspiration from. Which I guess he did here and there. But he only managed to scratch the surface, sadly.It felt like James Cameron doesn't understand the world he himself has established. He was on the verge of transmitting an incredibly wise message but failed to grasp the meaning that his storytelling has implicated so MANY TIMES.  Truly a disappointment.

I'd like to say so much more, but this shall be it for starters.

PS: Maybe I misunderstood some things, happy to discuss things with you guys.

&#x200B;

Edit:It seems there are some misunderstandings. #

First; I think that it's okay if they kill animals for food, I just don't believe a second that they would not care that they just made another of Eywas beings suffer and die. I just can't. They at the very least would be thankful and serious, not laughing and wagging the suffering animal around like a trophy.

Second; Alright, so they outcast the whale because he lead all those other whales an Na'vi to death because he wanted to fight against people. Its the tulkun way and so on and so on.But I have to stand my point, it is downright cruel. And I just can't believe beings so deeply and spiritually connected wouldn't understand his pain. And to top it off, in the movie everyone talks about him as if he was a monster. No one believed the younger brother when he said the whale was in fact kind and not a killer. So thats a huge problem for me right there.

Third; Yes Jake is american and the other humans loyal to the Na'vi could have had their influences, but tell me WHY do these tribes talk and feel like they were born in western society. That goes to far honestly. Completely missed the point of what they potrayed the Na'Vi as in the first movie. Neytiri, since she is like in the first movie, feels like the only one who is actually savage ( in the sense of being born in a tribe that lives on an alien planet and in nature). And what is the point of humanizing them even? To be able to relate to them you wouldn't need to make them as if they were americans? They feel so westernized, its just wrong. We have many cultures on this planet that feel more foreign than what we saw in the movie. This has USA written all over it and its agonizing.

And I doo like this movie, I love the Avatar franchise, but that does not make it immune of critisicm and criticism it desperately needs. In my opinion.",1671448476.0
