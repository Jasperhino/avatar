5,How do you think things will end?,101,1ar6548,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/1ar6548/how_do_you_think_things_will_end/,45,"Since Cameron is such an advocate for the environment and wants everyone who goes to watch the Avatar movies to come away as informed as possible, I wonder what you all think about the possibility that Cameron may begin with Avatar 3 to tell the story about how native peoples' struggle against the tyranny of colonization, no matter what species they are, always ends tragically.

I have never seen a film franchise as ambitious as a Hollywood blockbuster saga ending somberly. I think this would be actually breaking new ground because we're so used to big franchises ending well rather than bittersweet. And the thing is, if you imagine this franchise starting beautifully with Avatar 1 demonstrating the beauty and the awe inspiring nature of Pandora but ending the franchise with Pandora devastated by colonialism, it creates a journey/character arc for the planet itself.

The advantage of ending it in a bittersweet way, is for one, you attract all the people who feel that Avatar's a little too saccharin for their taste. Two, it also has a very interesting psychological effect on the demographic who consumes these movies; it teaches them that nothing good lasts forever, and that if we truly love the things that we love, we must fight to preserve them for as long as possible.

6,We will look back on the Avatar movies in very similar ways to how we look back on the Star Wars movies now.,101,zyhm4k,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zyhm4k/we_will_look_back_on_the_avatar_movies_in_very/,35,"Not taking away from the brilliance that is Star Wars and it‚Äôs unbelievably significant impact on both cinema and culture. You objectively cannot take away from that. 

What I‚Äôm saying is the same exact way we look at Star Wars with such a reverence, for both cinema and as a cultural phenomenon, we will do the same with Avatar, in time. 

Avatar will be the Star Wars of this time in cinema and culture. 

Avatar is going to revolutionize the movie theater experience. 

We are going to see new technologies and levels of immersion that have never been experienced before. 

The Avatar movies will be a game changer for the entertainment industry. They will easily match and likely surpass the cultural impact and financial prowess that both the Star Wars and MCU Universes have accomplished. 

This *does not* take away from those outstanding, magnificent works of entertainment. 

Avatar is the next step. 

The way we define ‚Äúgoing to the movies‚Äù or ‚Äúwatching a movie‚Äù is going to change, and the way that‚Äôs going to change is going to be brought to us through the Avatar movies and entertainment media. The way we relate to movies and consequently ourselves will be revolutionized by Avatar. 

This will be done primarily through technological advancements and also creative genius with thought provoking, deep, and spiritual story telling that is symbolically intwined with our reality here, both physically on earth and spiritually as soulful beings. We will find ourselves questioning reality, ourselves, our true nature, and of course our relationship with planet earth thanks to these movies. 

We will look back in awe and reverence. Avatar is just getting started.",1672350687.0
7,How I went from an Avatar hater (kind of) to an Avatar HUGE fan.,92,18l0uyn,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/18l0uyn/how_i_went_from_an_avatar_hater_kind_of_to_an/,18,"I'm 30 years old. When I was in high school I went to see the first Avatar ONLY because it was directed by James Cameron. The guy made some of my favorite movies of all time like Aliens, Titanic and the Termiantor movies. At that time I was disappointed about Avatar. I found the story very generic and predictable, I didn't care much about the characters and while undeniably a technical marvel, I wasn't into the idea of too much CGI (I'm a big fan of practical effects). So basically if you take a time machine to that time and talk to me about the movie, I would probably be one of those assholes that keep saying that Avatar is overrated, it's style over substance, 3D is cancer, The Legend of Aang is the ""true Avatar"" and blablabla.

Time passed and Avatar became a very bullied movie on the internet. Pretty much no post about ""overrated movies"" came without a mention of Avatar. Having casually rewatched the movie a couple of times (which is weird for me, because I don't rewatch movies I'm not a big fan of) I actually was thinking ""hey, it's not that bad, at least is entertaining, Cameron is a good storyteller"". You know, I was kind of slowly turning to the more positive side and felt sorry and tired that people kept saying it was overrated. 

More years past and FINALLY Avatar: The Way of Water released (I still remember when it was supposed to came out for 2015 lol). I saw it with my girlfriend on opening night and WOW! I freaking loved it. I don't know what was it, but it clicked so much on me. I did care a bit more about the characters this time around (old and new), I found some moments very emotional, I was in awe about the world, I loved the 3D experience and I found the action sequences so compelling and exciting. It was like everything people who loved Avatar felt with the first one I felt it with the second one. It's funny because most of my friends didn't like it and I endlessly defended it which made me committed to like the movie even more. I even rewatched it on IMAX which I rarely do. And as a James Cameron fan I was enchanted with how he evokes his passion for the ocean. 

I was thinking about all of this because recently I have been checking gameplay of the new game and I originally wasn't that interested in it, but after so many videos and reading fans enjoying the hell out of it, now I can't wait to play it. Right now I'm on a trip in Guatemala (which Mayan culture also made me think of Avatar haha) but as soon as I get home I'm getting this game.

And of course, I can't wait for Avatar 3. Damn, I might be also getting the movies on 4K. 

Thanks for reading. I just wanted to share this dumb story about my transition from hater to fan somewhere.",1702876056.0
8,Why is Kiri considered Mute?,75,wrlxi2,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/wrlxi2/why_is_kiri_considered_mute/,24,"I'm hearing people talk how this theory is being taken as cannon and wondering why. So my sister and I have been compiling together all the reasons why we think Kiri is most likely mute to clear things up.

**Outside Confirmations**

+ CJ Jones, a deaf actor was [hired to create a na'vi sign language.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/122993065/avatar-hire-renowned-deaf-actor-cj-jones-to-create-sign-language) It'd also have to accommodate a four-fingered peoples. There's been speculation Cameron intended this solely for underwater communication however all Cameron said was,

>‚ÄúWe did a scene last week with six teenagers, well, actually five teenagers and one 7-year-old underwater holding their breath for a couple minutes and acting, actually doing a dialogue scene under water because they speak kind of a sign language.‚Äù

He didn't outright say signing underwater was why he had it created. Cameron is a certified diver himself, he can easily come up with his own na'vi hand signs for inherently short dialogues underwater. Instead he commissioned the help of a deaf actor to come up with a brand new sign language with it's own syntax. If the signing is for diving, you ask a diver. If signing is for a disabled character, you ask a disabled actor.
CJ Jones is cast to play in the new movies but he's [not allowed to say who he's playing](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi4dDK4nds2/?hl=en). Why not? If it's to be the Metikayina translator which the IMDB assumes, what's the thinking? Why be tight-lipped about it? What better place to hide the secret that one of your leads is mute than putting the actor's coach in plain sight.

+ Sigourney Weaver, when asked about her role of Kiri, said she had to [learn how to act in a completely new way](https://mobile.twitter.com/avatarsequelsbr/status/1545892190106394625). She's playing a teenager but Sigourney doesn't need to learn how to act like a teen, she was one once; if anything she'd need a refresher as it's been fifty years. If she's playing a mute, then she'd need an acting coach on not only how to sign, but how to act with sign. In Guillermo del Toro 2017 'Shape of Water' Sally Hawkins plays Elisa, a mute woman. 

>‚ÄúTo make sure Hawkins got it right, the production hired two ASL coaches, one of whom was Amanda Richer, an actress, director, and producer.‚Äù

Hawkins had to train for months under Richer so she could play a convincing ASL signer. 
Not only does ‚ÄúThe Shape of Water sound similar to ‚ÄúThe Way of Water‚Äù, but Guillermo del Toro happens to be one of James Cameron's close personal friends; and buddy story-tellers love to bounce ideas off one another.

**Technical Reasons**

The voice issue. If Kiri is playing a na'vi teen on the cusp of adulthood, but played by a woman in her seventies, there are three options going forward if Kiri does speak.


+ Sigourney uses her own voice. There'd be a disconnect registering Kiri as young if her voice is old. Sigourney could do a voice but she's not a voice actress and for the roles she has lent her voice to, the range is much the same as her regular speaking voice. She always sounds like Sigourney, a woman who captures your attention through the authority in her tone. 

+ They modulate her voice. This might work for a speaking line or two but for four movies it'd get very old very quick. It'd alienate the audience from an already alien character.

+ The dub. Dubs have the disadvantage of vocal dissonance from the actors' performance, it can be done and done well but it's not ideal especially for a blockbuster saga. On top of that, no actress is listed as playing her voice. Maybe they're keeping it secret, okay why? They're not secretive about Kiri being played by Sigourney, so what's there to hide about a dub to bypass the voice issue? 

**Story Related Reasons**

+ Kiri is described as not being **prepossessing**; *impressive to others, esp. Immediately.* Sigourney's voice is impressive to others; the only way I see her playing the realistic role of a wallflower is if she talks little or not at all.

+ Kiri is also trying to find out who she is. If she doesn't know who she is then she doesn't know her own voice. This could be played up on a literal level.

+ If Kiri is mute, she'd have an affinity for being underwater for this would be the one world where everyone is rendered like her: unable to talk.

+ Jake's kids would already have to know sign in order to talk underwater with the Metkayina kids. So na'vi sign is universal for the same reason their speaking tongue is. The Metkayina have reason to use it more frequently than the Omaticaya yet it sounds like Jake's kids are well-versed in it already.

+ Kiri's movements and appearance is much like a woodsprite, or as the na'vi call it, 'Atokirina' A-T-O-**K-I-R-I**-N-A. Her connections to Eywa are already irrefutable but her physical similarities to the seeds of Eywa can't go ignored. Woodsprites are *silent*, harmless, pure spirits of the forest. So unassuming yet the moment one catches your eye it commands your attention, because how could you not be in awe for something so ethereal? Kiri, if she signs, will command the attention of the whole audience as they try and figure out what she's trying to say, just as the na'vi try to figure out what the Atokirina's are saying.

+ In a [shot of her with her family](https://ibb.co/fSxhDmP), she's touching Neteyam's back despite him being injured. In another [shot of Lo'ak looking up into the sky](https://ibb.co/YNbf85V) there's a head in the bottom right corner; the facial stripes and headband match Neytiri's but there's a set of hands rubbing her head. Those hands are small, feminine and five-fingered; consider they'd have to belong to someone with a close connection to Neytiri to deign such touch, then only Kiri qualifies.
In deaf/mute culture, on top of sign, people communicate through feels/touch: expressing themselves via tactile input in lieu of speaking. Only a family inured to feels/touch would not be unsettled by this strange behaviour, which to the deaf/mute is not strange at all but completely natural.

+ If she's a personification/extension of Eywa, well Eywa doesn't talk. Secondly the na'vi mantra is *To See*. The only way you can understand Kiri is if you *see her* just as the na'vi people see into Pandora. Being mute would showcase the symbolic meaning of this mantra on a tangible level.

+ Feels/touch would be normal to the Sully's but it'd be completely unsettling to anyone outside of the na'vi understanding. I'm referring to the recoms, specifically Quartich. Quaritch will be unnerved by Kiri just as Jake was by the woodsprites. (Jake even whacked one in a jerk reaction). Their shared marine training has/will fail to prepare them for something so harmless and so unassuming as a woodsprite; something that you don't realize until it's too late just how powerless you are to it's affect on you.
Direct quote from Stephen Lang regarding Quaritch in the upcoming movies.
> The world begins to ‚Äì the world of Pandora ‚Äì begins to affect him quite deeply in ways that he either refused or it did not affect him. And it gets under his skin.‚Äù

If Kiri represents Pandora, then she's going to get under his skin. She'll be the deadliest thing he ever encountered because this anthropomorphic woodsprite has the power to make him soft. And that'll bug the hell out of him.

**Personal Reasons**

+ Cameron's not afraid to write disabled heros. Jake Sully was a paraplegic. 

+ Now I'm going to insert myself and say that deaf/mute culture is a fascinating world that rewards anyone who goes out of their way to learn about it. For an inquisitive, empathetic soul like Cameron I don't see him being indifferent to the world of signing. Rather he'd showcase it in his work when given the chance. He sees beauty all around him and what better place to show it than this mangum opus that is his Avatar saga?",1660835172.0
9,This Diehard Fan‚Äôs Thoughts on TWOW So Far,68,zocn46,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zocn46/this_diehard_fans_thoughts_on_twow_so_far/,20,"
- This movie is gorgeous, this we all know. I have ADHD and can‚Äôt sit still to save my life, yet I barely fidgeted through the 3-hour runtime.
- Going in with the understanding that we‚Äôre now in full franchise mode makes this movie easier to follow and allowed me to sit comfortably with unfinished/not fully fleshed out story lines knowing that they‚Äôll be continued soon. 
- Since it‚Äôs sci-fi, I decided before release that I‚Äôd go with the flow in regards to Quaritch, Kiri, and language.
- Jake has so much more to lose in this movie. I could feel his anguish as he was proposing leaving the People to Neytiri. Making the choice to leave, giving up so much to protect his family is the heart of this movie.
- The kids were all fantastic. Being a typical middle child, married to a ‚Äúperfect son‚Äù oldest child, I could really empathize with Lo‚Äôak and his relationship with Neteyam; the love and the desire to be seen as you really are outside of someone‚Äôs shadow.
- I was surprised by how interested I am in Quaritch now. There‚Äôs a lot to be fleshed out there.
- The similarities between Jake and Quaritch were particularly interesting to me. Two examples that stood out to me: Their shared use of the word ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù, when faced with a difficult task (Blue Unit being test dummies for combating Pandora‚Äôs immune response in the mountains/Jake about to choose his banshee). Their similar scenes with their banshees over their shoulders bearing their teeth when needing to convey their strength and resolve (Quaritch commandeering the whaling vessel/Jake returning to the People with Toruk). 
- I predict very interesting character development for Quaritch. He yielded killing the Tsah√¨k and burned the Metkayina village instead, he wanted his son to go with him in the end and the biggest event for me was his bonding with an ikran. I think he will begin to feel the Na‚Äôvi pull to the moon and the pull to Eywa; to respect the moon and all of its living beings. I could see him railing against that inner nature now that he is an Avatar, and absolutely hating how drawn he is to those feelings/urges/things. Will he be the villain to Jake this whole time? Or to the RDA? 
- James Cameron is a devout environmentalist and has said many times over that these movies have a very clear message; protect the planet. I cherish this message and admire his unyielding loyalty to his values.
- One of my main disappointments was with the soundtrack. For me, it was generic and forgettable with the only exceptions being excerpts from the OST. Avatar has a glorious soundtrack layered with different and unique instruments which all conveyed the tribal beauty of Pandora. I missed that greatly. I didn‚Äôt feel that there was the same emotional accompanying music that was poignant and memorable.
- My last big disappointment, which was due to my own hope and imagination, was not seeing Neytiri choose her new ikran. Personally, I always bond with creatures in movies over humans/humanoids. I adore Neytiri and have admired her since 2009, and I wanted to see her tackle this same ferocious task that we got to see Jake take on in Avatar.
- I do feel that we didn‚Äôt see enough of Neytiri, but I think that will change as the movies continue, this one was truly about the kids. In the end when I saw her heart rend further when he father‚Äôs bow was broken, I felt that this movie could have been redubbed as Neytiri Can‚Äôt Catch A Break. Our girl needs to win in a big way in the next movie. 
- Her rage was awe-inspiring, vicious, and truly frightening. Watching her fire an arrow through one of her victims and break necks with her bow? Wow. 
- Ronal and Tonowari were incredible and I can‚Äôt wait to see more of them
- I want an ilu",1671301763.0

There's a sense of awe and reverence in his delivery, suggesting that Quaritch has taken on this larger-than-life place in the cultural history of the Na'vi, a boogeyman to be feared and respected. And since the younger generation are more comfortable with technology, that same reverence becomes attached to artefacts associated with Quaritch, like his AMP suit.

Speaking of artefacts, one wonder's where Jake's wheelchair is. I doubt it would be thrown away since it is useful to have should any of the humans suffer a leg injury, but it potentially has cultural importance as a relic of Toruk Makto... either that or it would be great fun for the younger Na'vi kids to play on!",1673280669.0

13,That Post-Avatar Emptiness,45,102wv8t,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/102wv8t/that_postavatar_emptiness/,4,"I'm aware that most of the people in this subreddit are aware of the ""Post-Avatar blues"", but I just wanted to talk about how persistent and unique this feeling is - it's something I've **NEVER** felt for any other movie I've ever watched.

I've watched Avatar TWOW three times now, and after *every single viewing* I feel an overwhelming emptiness and sadness that I'm no longer immersed in that fictional universe. 

I've truly never seen such a visually beautiful movie on the level of Avatar TWOW before. Never. It is hands down the *best looking* movie I have ever seen. I watched it in 3D UltraAVX Dolby ATMOS just a few hours ago for the first time (the first viewing was completely regular - a huge mistake - and the second viewing was basic 3D, no special screen or sound) and it wasn't even like looking at a screen. It was like looking into a REAL window into the world of Avatar. During moments when the screen would go black and I was reminded I was in a movie theatre and not at Pandora, I'd feel myself confused for a split-second, forgetting that what I was watching wasn't real. It's like it isn't even a movie - it's a whole otherworldly experience (no pun intended). The super close-up shot of Neytiri at the very beginning of the movie never fails to shock me as to how detailed and real she looks, and the ""shark"" scene actually makes me push back into my chair when the ""shark"" charges at Lo'ak because it really is like the ""shark"" is charging straight at the screen and will go through it.

Then, the movie ends and I walk out of the theatre and not even kidding, it's like for a moment I am confused as to what's real and what isn't. That's how damn beautiful that movie is. It literally looks more real than reality itself. And here I am typing this, with this same old empty feeling I've felt after every viewing, just in awe as to how someone could make such a beautiful movie.

This is the only movie I've watched 2+ times in theatres, and each time I've never been bored. It never gets old.

16,"Why The Narrative Structure of TWOW Felt ""Off"" [SPOILERS]",42,10fth16,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/10fth16/why_the_narrative_structure_of_twow_felt_off/,23,"Disclaimer: This is mostly just me coming to a revelation about something that had been bothering me for a while. I mean no offense I just love writing about and analyzing Avatar and The Way of Water. Please feel free to let me know what you think if you would like to! Again, this isn't hate on the movie just something I noticed about the way I interpreted it. 

When I saw The Way of Water in theatres for the first time, something just felt‚Ä¶ off about it. I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on what it was. The visuals were beautiful, the characters were alright, the ending was emotional. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but neither was the first movie. I *loved* the first movie. Immediately after I watched it, I was totally obsessed with it and the worldbuilding that went into it. Still to this day I love the story, the characters, the filmmaking that went into it, the cinematography, the effects, the cheesy dialogue, the incredibly tragic and emotional scenes that James Cameron poured his heart into. After my second viewing of The Way of Water, I felt like something was missing, but I still couldn‚Äôt tell what. I thought it was the pacing, but even that didn‚Äôt feel right to me. I thought about it a lot and I just realized that it‚Äôs not just the pacing of the whole movie, it‚Äôs the structure of the scenes‚Ä¶ of lack thereof. 

For most of the movie, scenes just start with little to no context in the broader scope of the film and end abruptly with no conclusion. Ideas and conflict are introduced and then dropped in the same scene. There is ""payoff"" with no ""setup"". Let me explain. 

In film, a complete scene is basically its own mini-story. It has to be able to ""stand alone"" in a competent way (have a comprehensible beginning, middle, and end). When writing a scene, you can't just drop characters in a place and take them out just as quickly. To put into context, I'll dissect a scene from the first Avatar- starting with Jake's first time in his Avatar body. I'll try to keep it brief because I know nobody likes to read a novel on Reddit. 

**Beginning**: Jake enters his link chamber and has some fun banter with Grace. It is established that he has no idea what he's doing, hasn't trained at all, and Grace gives him sass for it. He responds just as wittily and a character dynamic is quickly established. Norm confidently enters his link chamber.

**Introduced** (recurring) **conflict**: Jake is paralyzed and struggles to get around, but he refuses help from Grace/anyone else. He has his line that establishes that he was/is sick of doctors telling him what to do (this leads to an understanding between the two).

**Middle**: Jake wakes up in his Avatar body, surrounded by doctors. Norm in the background is confidently running through link tests while Jake ignores the doctors (telling him what to do, ha ha)  because he realizes he can feel and move his legs. He stands up, wreaking havoc in the room, knocking things over with his new tail, stumbling around. He breaks out of the room and runs for the first time since he became paralyzed. He stops and feels the ground under his feet, closing his eyes. He snaps out of it when Grace calls out to him. They exchange a few words and she throws him a fruit, which he eats. He is in awe with everything around him.

**End**: The Avatars are now in an outdoor cabin, laying in beds. Grace checks up on everyone, makes an offhanded remark about the neural queue to Jake, who is established to not know what it is, and they go to sleep. Jake wakes up in his normal body and can no longer use his legs.

This is a great scene. And it works on its own, too. In the scene you get provided all the context you need: Jake is paralyzed but he doesn't let that stop him. He's stubborn and he and Grace butt heads over it, but after a remark from him about doctors telling him what he couldn't do, he seems to earn some of her respect.

Norm is confident in his Avatar body and confident with his ability to link with it, Jake is uncertain and clumsy.

Jake loves his Avatar body more than his human body, and he clearly loves Pandora more than anything else. He breathes the air in deeply, is in awe by the fruit he eats. He and Grace start to see eye to eye better after the linking process. When he finally has to wake up, he's disappointed with the limits of being human paired with his paralysis.

All of this context also does a great job setting up his motivations to help Quaritch and his eventual turning on the RDA (he helped Quaritch because he was promised his legs back, and turned on him because he found purpose living on Pandora).

There is also setup that gets payoff later in the movie: We find out the importance of the braid and what it is, we get the Jake surpassing Norm foreshadowing, etc. 

This is the same for almost every part of Avatar. I'd go into it further, but it would just take up space, and I'm already rambling quite a bit. James Cameron wrote the script on his own and, from my understanding, had to wait until technology had caught up with his ideas. It was a standalone story at the time and it had to be simple and contained to be adapted into a movie. I think these restraints actually ended up benefitting the final film. The Way of Water didn't have the luxury of limitations. It had all the time and money in the world and a dedicated fanbase patiently waiting for its release. 

&#x200B;

In The Way of Water, things just... happen. Sure, it happens in sequence, but it's missing those key elements that make it cohesive. 

Let me break it down breifly using the first swimming scene as an example because it was the first one that came to mind when I had this realization. 

**Beginning**: the kids dive into the water and can‚Äôt swim as well as the Metkayina children can

**Middle**: They surface and Aonung picks on them for not being able to swim as well. Tsireya, the mediator, urges him to stop.

**Conflict** is introduced: Kiri is missing, the kids panic a little as they look and can‚Äôt find her. They call her name, their calls getting more frantic as she fails to make an appearance.

Cut to Kiri swimming just fine, having no problems at all unlike her siblings. Then the scene ends. 

With this introduced conflict, the resolution would usually be for the kids to locate Kiri and see that she is fine, ending their panic (for all they know, Kiri could be drowning. She could be struggling to surface, she could have run out of air. The ocean is still dangerous to the Omaticaya, and if she dove too far down, it could be fatal). Them seeing Kiri swimming could have been met with curiosity, or a ‚Äúhow is she so good at this?‚Äù moment. But instead, the scene just‚Ä¶ ends. We see Kiri swimming alone at the ocean floor, the kids don‚Äôt. There is no resolution to the conflict introduced in the scene for the kids. We don‚Äôt know if they are aware of her swimming abilities, if they found her, how they reacted to it: all important interactions to have, especially setting up Kiri‚Äôs abilities being revealed at the end.

There‚Äôs also the scene where Payakan is introduced. The scene begins with Lo‚Äôak waking up on Payakan‚Äôs back.

**Beginning**: Lo‚Äôak wakes up, realizes he‚Äôs not on dry land but actually on a massive creature. He tries speaking to it.

**Middle**, introduction of conflict: The tulkun has a harpoon stuck in its fin. Lo‚Äôak spends a few seconds removing it. He signs ‚Äúfriends‚Äù to the tulkun.

**End**: They swim around for fun in the ocean for an unidentifiable amount of time.

Of course, this scene is also sandwiched between Lo‚Äôak getting lost beyond the reef and him returning home. This isn‚Äôt mentioned in that scene. It feels so isolated from the overarching story. He does not mention having to get home, he instead swims around with Payakan in a montage that kind of just happens and abruptly ends. 

Skip forward to night time and Lo‚Äôak still hasn‚Äôt returned home, and his family is only just *now* realizing that he‚Äôs gone missing. We get an isolated scene where Neteyam drags Aonung to Jake and makes him tell him what happened. That scene also just‚Ä¶ ends. Just like it just starts with no context.

Even the scene where the RDA tracks the helicopter could have been a payoff scene. All they would have had to do was show the helicopter turning on and we could have gotten an ominous radar beep. Anything signaling that something was wrong. 

The movie also had a habit of dropping things into the narrative just to have them there: one such thing being Spider's mask tracker. It's mentioned once, and never is there any payoff for that little tidbit. He is just allowed to flee and doesn't for a second worry about the tracker giving away the location of the Sully family. 

Come to think of it, I don't think there was ever a scene of the characters traveling from Point A to Point B aside from the glamor shots of the Metkayina boys doing tricks in the air with Lo'ak. Scenes usually start and end in the same spot. They don't swim out into the ocean to meet up, scenes just started with them already together or apart. It kind of felt like the screenwriters were saying ""They're over here."" ""It's a different day now and now they are over here doing something else"" ""But this other character is way over here"" ""Now they're in the same place again"". 

I realized my frustration came from the fact that a lot of the context in the movie is just implied to happen. It's left to the audience's interpretation. You can assume that the kids eventually found Kiri swimming very well. You can just *assume* that Neteyam confronted Aonung about his missing brother. You can just *assume* that the Tulkun eventually left after they told stories to each other. You can just *assume* that some of the adults in the Metkayina tribe eventually broke up the fight between Aonung, his posse of bullies, and Jake's sons. You can just *assume* that the kids all gathered together the day after Lo'ak went missing to ask him how he got back. You can *assume* that Neytiri actually did undergo some training with the Metkayina. You can assume that Aonung struggles to live up to the expectations that his parents place on him just like Lo'ak. You can assume that Aonung and Rotxo returned safely home during the final fight... the list goes on. 

In smaller scenes, it can be glossed over and forgiven because it doesn't really impact the narrative aside from leaving a few questions (that can be pushes aside and explained away quickly with theories and headcanons and assumptions), but that's why we ended up with the Metkayina disappearing at the end. Stuff like that had been happening for the whole movie, we just didn't notice it because it wasn't as noticeable as an entire clan of people vanishing into thin air. 

Something that disappoints me about this approach is the fact that we'll probably never have any real answers as to what happened in all of these missing in-between moments since Jon Landau confirmed that there won't be an extended edition of The Way of Water.

I guess these oversights and strangely set up scenes can be accredited to the writers James Cameron chose (I'm still a little puzzled as to why he chose screenwriters who have only made their mark writing reboots \[Jurassic World, the Planet of the Apes reboot, and the live action Mulan\]). It didn't really impact my enjoyment of the movie all that much, but it did leave me confused as to how I felt about it. A friend of mine jokingly described watching the movie like ""being edged the whole time"" because of how scenes just ended without necessarily being concluded. I thought that was pretty funny. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share my thoughts. In no way was this meant to be flammatory or to detract from anyone's enjoyment of the movie, just my thoughts as someone who studies and finds enjoyment in breaking down media and the reasons why I love (and sometimes am confused by) movies. I love posting about Avatar, though, because it's so rich and there's so much to talk about when it comes to the filmmaking.",1674105840.0

I rewatched the movie yesterday (10 years later) and it was a whole new experience, now I'm obsessed with the plants! I watch the night scenes where the fauna really starts to open and come alive and it awes me, relaxing and immersive.

Say I want to add a bit of avatar fauna style to my bedroom?

The world‚Äîthe CGI‚Äîthe wildlife‚Äîit captivated me. I fell in love with Pandora ~~and Neytiri~~ and could feel Jake's awe of the world around him. The story, while not anything groundbreaking in my opinion, still served its purpose. This movie was truly special for 9 year old me.



For some reason, though, I rarely heard anyone talking about Avatar in the years that followed. On the few occasions it was mentioned, people would joke that there was nothing memorable about the movie was despite it being one of the highest grossing films of all time. It seemed almost every opinion of Avatar veered from utter indifference to scathing critique. I started feeling bad for liking Avatar at all. ""Am I wrong for genuinely loving this movie? How come I can't find any fans who like it too?"" :(



Needless to say, I was *ecstatic* when I discovered this subreddit. It's so fun connecting with a smaller fandom of a rather underappreciated media. Seeing genuine Avatar fans fills my little heart with joy. ^ v ^



Avatar's not perfect. I have my gripes with it, and people are allowed to dislike it or not care about it altogether. And that's fine. But I'm not jumping on the hate bandwagon anymore. I love Avatar, flaws and all. :)

23,Concern Over The Score of Upcoming Films,23,b5lco3,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/b5lco3/concern_over_the_score_of_upcoming_films/,10,"As we slowly approach the release of the sequels, I want to discuss my concern over the quality of the music in the upcoming films. The music in the first film was absolutely incredible, and, truthfully, there is no other score that brings me to a more base level of peace and restitution than that of Avatar's. James Horner's composition is truly indescribable, and it undeniably played an incredibly crucial role in enveloping audiences as much as the movie did and still does. 

&#x200B;

With Horner's heartbreaking death in 2015, the upcoming films were left composer-less. Knowing this causes a massive amount of anxiety in me, as I am a firm believer in the importance and impact of a score, and know how strongly Horner's score impacts the film. James Cameron himself said he has no idea who will score the movies, per my memory after Horner's passing. So, I've come here to ask if anyone has received any updates or rumors on potential composers. Secondly, I am here to suggest Harry-Gregson Williams should take the helm if one has not been selected. I have long had an idea to put some of his music from the first Narnia film over select scenes from Avatar, as I believe they would fit incredibly well. Additionally, Williams simply seems to be able to conjure music which conveys similar feelings of awe, wonder, and other feelings of indescribable peace I feel when listening to Horner's score. I would love to begin working on this, but I first would need to remove Horner's score from these scenes, which is something I have absolutely no idea how to do. So, is anyone able to help out with this?

So I went to Disney World last October of '19 and at that point I had never seen Avatar. Pandora in Animal Kingdom was amazing (didn't ride the rides there then) and when I got home Disney+ launched and I watched the movie. I thought it was good, but not my favorite or anything.

Anyways, I went to Disney again over this Christmas, and went to Pandora again, this time having seen the movie, and I rode both the rides! First, let me say Flight of Passage might be one of the best things I ever experienced. Not only was the ride an indescribable experience, but it'll make even the biggest hater a fan of Avatar. The river journey was good too, but not as awe inspiring. Though the animatronic of the shaman was next level. I left the park with a new obsession not so much for the movie, but the created world of Pandora.

I just watched the movie again tonight, with this new appreciation, and let me say my feelings have changed. Definitely one of my favorite movies now. I still think Jake is a bit annoying and a huge idiot, but I suppose that was the point. I now cannot wait for the new supposed ocean based sequel to come out!

28,A space nerd's quick and dirty theory of the Polyphemian moon system,18,zor8we,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zor8we/a_space_nerds_quick_and_dirty_theory_of_the/,18,"Okay so:

For a long time I thought the first movie was unrealistic, because it showed Pandora having a seemingly Earth-like day-night cycle. This despite being that, like any other moon, it would be tidally locked to its (rather massive) parent, and thus have a ""day"" in sync with its orbital period.

But then I learned that Mimas - [the Death Star-looking tenth moon of Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimas_(moon)) \- has a ""day"" only 23 hours long. Thus I learned that massive planets can make their inner moons orbit fast compared to ours (witness Io's 42 hours vs. Luna's 29.5 days, despite Io being further from Jupiter than Luna is from Earth), and so theorized that Pandora is probably a lot closer to Polyphemus than I originally thought. The background visuals in the first movie are still inconsistent, but the day-night cycle actually makes sense now.

And after having just walked out of TWoW - awed, stunned and pleasantly surprised by Cameron reading my mind and including eclipses - I now have this working theory of Pandora and her fellow moons:

**1.** Pandora's day-night cycle is probably around 30-35 hours long. Significantly longer than a Terran day, but not by too much.

**2.** We glimpsed two inner moons in the first movie, each almost certainly smaller than Luna. Given how massive Pandora is in comparison, they'd all be locked in a strict orbital resonance with each other, similar to the 2:1 resonance of Io and Europa.

**3.** Also like Io and Europa, the gravitational tugging between the moons and the gas giant is what's driving Pandora's geologic activity, such as the inner heat producing the strong magnetic fields that make the mountains float. Would also make it interesting to know how volcanic Pandora is.

**4.** Pandora certainly orbits closer than Luna to Earth, so the two inner moons might be right up against Polyphemus' [Roche limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit). The reason why there's no obvious ring system might be because of the gravity of all three disrupting the formation of any, though it may be that one of the inner moons might fall in and become a ring in the next few million years.

**5.** The official wiki says Pandora has an axial tilt of 29¬∞, which would strongly imply that Polyphemus and the orbits of all its moons do as well. This tilt (greater than Saturn's) would mean that the eclipses are seasonal, occuring only around the time of the equinoxes. Therefore, we can assume that TWoW happens during either Pandoran ""spring"" or ""autumn"", while the absence of eclipses in the first movie sets it in ""summer"" or ""winter"". And it would also be fair to assume that the weather changes with the seasons too, albeit differently than on Earth. The high level of CO2 seems to be making the whole moon pretty tropical already, so I'm guessing there's a dry and rainy season?

**6.** It's a movie why tf am I overthinking this XD

So yeah! I'm not an actual astrophysicist by any stretch of the imagination, but as a lifelong space nerd who was never good at math this is my contribution. It'd be interesting to know if Cameron thought of any of this himself.",1671342200.0

Visually this movie was almost as beautiful as the first, I think the updated CGI really made the movie feel more immersive. I say almost because nothing will ever awe me as much as the first Avatar did, the way it really felt like a completely different world. On it's own, I think because the ocean is already so alien it didn't feel that different from Earth's ocean. The visuals however were what truly carried this movie for me, aside from Zoe Saldana's amazing acting and ability portray pain. The storyline however ruined my experience a little bit. 

I loved that we get see Jake grow and become accepted into the tribe and have children, and we get to see his children. But I feel like I didn't truly get to ""meet"" his children and build any connection to their children. So when it came to the death of the eldest son, it wasn't as impactful as it could have been (Zoe truly carried all the emotion in that scene and the fight scenes following). I honestly don't even remember the kids names aside from Spider and Kiri. Speaking of Spider and Kiri, where the fuck did they come from? Kiri makes a bit more sense (she's basically a clone of Dr. Grace and its insinuated she's the daughter of Eywa, like Jesus kinda) but I feel like Spider was such a randomly placed character who felt super out of place for me the whole movie. It felt like he was written in just to show the Colonel had feelings. Their relationship never landed for me because Spider didn't exist in the first movie and Colonel died, so they had no bond to each other. Also bringing the Colonel back to life in Avatar form felt like lazy writing to me because this whole movie plot felt like a copy paste of the original but worse. 

I think I wanted to see more of Jake exploring more of Pandora with his family and the conflicts of being a ""demon"" among the native Na'vi, which was touched on but never fully explored or resolved? Like I was kind of expecting more of a ""life after the sky people war"" and more ""life on pandora, exploration of the na'vi tribes and cultures."" 

TLDR; The movie is visually stunning but the storyline falls flat.",1671222247.0

35,"Soundtrack suites I made for ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" (and how I think this score improves over the original)",8,109e45d,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/109e45d/soundtrack_suites_i_made_for_avatar_the_way_of/,0,"Hi there, as I mentioned in my previous post, here's the separate post for the suites I made for Avatar: The Way of Water. Once again, you can view all my suites for the 2 Avatar movies in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0RFIinblt6_Qm5QWuLeiONBOihUpiVN).

Generally speaking, I don't think the music for Avatar 2 is not as good compared to the first one - actually I tend to believe the opposite. For some reasons, I like this more than the previous movie. I had to give this score a second chance, since I somehow expected to hear Horner's themes everywhere when I watch Avatar 2 for the first time - and when the movie ended I didn't feel impressed from the score, aside from the Songcord theme.  
But listening to the soundtrack after watching the movie was really what made me fall in love with it. I noticed more variations of the Songcord theme, I came to love the Ocean theme and Payakan's theme, and enjoyed the intensity of the action tracks - and each of these three key elements from the score seems to improve over Horner's score in the first film.

* The Songcord provides a more mature emotional ground for the entire film: you have hope and despair, intimacy and tragedy, adrenaline and peace all gathered within the same musical melody, whereas the main theme in the first one was only associated with awe and wonder. From this perspective, Simon Franglen really put a lot of effort to make this theme work with the variety of emotions required by the movie.
* The Ocean and Payakan themes deliver a fresh and exciting approach to describe the beauty of Pandora (this time the ocean rather than the forest), while also been challenged by not relying exclusively on the main theme. He used experimental sounds and explored new instruments to catch the right soundscape, and he really nailed it.
* As for the villains, the humans have now their sporadical but actual musical theme (""A New Star"") that feels more aggressive and ""muscular"" compared to the first one where the humans don't even have a theme. The score delivers great moments filled with tension, like ""Kids in Peril"" - and in the final act it just blows with a great combination of action and suspence.

The score of the first Avatar will always remain a classic, especially for the main theme variations, but The Way of Water represents a great musical evolution and a promising start for the sequels to come. I still hope that, by collection these themes together in these videos, you'll be able to related in a more fullfilling way to the score of The Way of Water, and come to appreciate and enjoy it as much as you want.

So, finally, here's my videos for Avatar: The Way of Water:

1 - [The Songcord (Theme)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC4M12_7-0k&t=783s)  
The greatest musical addition to TWOW is the Songcord, which is incredibly moving and touching considering the way it was used extensively in the movie. Apart from the vocal song from Zoe Saldana, other great tracks like ""From Darkness to Light"", ""Sanctuary"" and ""The Spirit Tree"" features an instrumetal version of this theme. It also amazes me that Franglen managed to make variation in action style of this theme in ""Bad Parents"" and ""Na'vi Attack"", which is something that Horner didn't do with his themes.

2 - [Ocean & Tulkun (Suite)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOSZxGZPE0Y)  
This video is made to collect and mix together the ocean theme (""Into the Water"", ""The Way of Water"" and ""The Tulkun Return"") and Payakan's theme (""Payakan"" and ""Friends""), and this is my favourite part of the score of the sequel and possibly even the saga so far. Honestly I can't get this mix out of my head because it's just so wonderful and enchanting. The underwater sequence and the Payakan scenes were the ones I'll always look up to smile and remember why I loved this sequel - and why it was worth so many years of wait.

3 - [War on Pandora (Suite)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZMXU8XSYnY&t=407s)  
I made this video thinking of it as a ""villain"" montage and more action focused. It feautures ""A New Star"", ""Rescue and Loss"" and then it moves to the final act of the movie. I love the intensity and epic scale of tracks like ""Bad Parents"" and ""Knife Fight"", which really convey the crazy action scenes going on. Also, it tried to collect here the various reprised of ""Death of Quaritch"" from the first movie (briefly used in ""Rescue and Loss"" and mainly in ""Upside Down"").

4 - [Avatar: The Way of Water (Main Action Theme)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T7rFLW_3GM)  
This mix is similar to ""War on Pandora"", but it's shorter and features reprises of the Songcord and the Main Theme I edited out from tracks like ""Bad Parents"" and ""Na'vi Attack"" in the previous video. Also, noticing how similar are ""Train Attack"" and ""Na'vi Attack"" this video mixes them together. This one is more ""epic"" sort to say, whereas the other is mostly villain-focused.

So that's about it. It took me a long time and a lot of work to produce the whole Avatar suite series, so I hope that those who'll watch them will enjoy the effort - but mostly, I wish you'll come to love more Simon Franglen's work!",1673466807.0
36,Nitpicky Plot Discussions about the plot of A:TWOW,7,14bfvha,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/14bfvha/nitpicky_plot_discussions_about_the_plot_of_atwow/,4,"Back in my initial review of the movie, I wrote about how it felt disorganized and as though it lacked a solid point of focus and very loose characterization. Since then, I've thought long and hard about it and read through some differing viewpoints, including those of people who initially *hated* the first movie for lacking a plot but oppositely praised this one for its ""cohesive plot"". This is by no means a targeted, unfair, biased criticism, but then again, all works of art are subject to criticism. That's what comes with putting your work out there. This is to generate discussion among other fans of the movies. And considering the fact that we have plenty of time until the next movie, there's a LOT to talk about, still. 

Here are some of my general questions and nitpicks about the plot meant to generate discussion. 

DISCLAIMER: I haven't seen the movie in a while, but I did see it multiple times. 

&#x200B;

**1.  Why did Jake run away from the most fortified, safest place in the entire Pandoran jungle?** The Hallelujah Mountains had become their base for a reason: The RDA could not reach them. It was heavily fortified and populated by all walks of Na'vi warriors and Avatar soldiers. Apart from everywhere else in Omaticaya territory, the Hallelujah Mountains remained untouched. The atmosphere disoriented all aircraft, making it impossible to navigate-- and thanks to Eywa's protection, swarms and swarms of banshees would attack and take down any aircraft in the vicinity. As far as Jake and the other Omaticaya were concerned, their only new threat were Recoms, which Jake and Neytiri had already taken out with ease. Even if they did acquire Ikran (which they eventually did), the Omaticaya would still be at a greater advantage, having ridden Banshees for much longer. It was literally ingrained in their culture. Instead of fortifying the base, keeping his children from flying anymore missions, and assuming that their lives quite literally being at risk would scare them into no longer wandering into enemy territory unprotected, he just... runs away. With only his wife and kids. Abandoning the rest of the Omaticaya- the clan that he had spent years becoming a part of and eventually *leading* the entire clan after the deaths of Neytiri's father Eytukan and Tsu'tey. He leaves them, knowing that Quaritch will still hunt him down and will thereby continue to assume that he is still holed up with the Omaticaya, actively endangering them and leaving them under the command of some unnamed, much younger Na'vi. 

That did not make any sense to me. Sure, he was trying to ""protect his family"", but did he not think that his kids would no longer try to wander off after almost being killed by the recoms? Why not put his kids in lockdown and use his knowledge of the recoms' existence to prepare the other Omaticaya to fight an enemy that can ""bypass"" Eywa's protection? His first move was really to fully abandon the Omaticaya with little to no direction and move himself and his family, all of whom had MASSIVE targets on their backs, to a peaceful, isolated fishing village. Putting them in more danger than the Omaticaya because they lacked the biological and geological advantage against the RDA (the magnetic pull of the Halelujah Mountains and the ""immune response"" from Eywa. Him moving his family really just put everyone in even more danger. The Omaticaya were left without their leader who had extensive knowledge of RDA war tactics and weaponry, the Metkayina and their neighboring clans because prime targets, Jake's family were no longer well-hidden in a strong, military reinforced base, etc. 

All in all, I know that the only real explanation for this sudden move to a new biome was because James Cameron really, REALLY loves the ocean and wanted to fully incorporate it into his next film, but I feel like the reasoning in the narrative was a little bit loose and rushed. 

 

**2. Why did no-one ever mention Spider again?** Sure, Kiri is extremely distressed at his initial capture, but aside from that, I'm pretty sure the only other mention of Spider is when Jake asks Kiri if she misses him and she says something along the lines of ""yeah but that's not what's wrong"". You would expect literally anyone else to also make some kind of comment like ""we can't leave him behind"" or maybe have Lo'ak and Neteyam craft some impossible rescue mission planning on going back to the forest behind their father's back. Anything at all. This total detachment from his character made him feel... expendable. There isn't even any concern from the Norm or Max or any of the Avatars or the human scientists who were shown to have raised him. Any sort of reaction at all to remind us that Spider is a character with a connection to these people would have been relevant to the plot. It also would have attached his narrative segments to the rest of the movie. They all moved on past Spider way too quickly. I mean, he was captured by the people who held them at knifepoint and gunpoint in the woods. Some concern, especially from Jake, who was the most sympathetic of the adults to him. Overall, this oversight made him feel completely disconnected, and it felt like none of the characters really cared about him or talked about him unless he was on-screen with them. 

&#x200B;

**3. Why did the RDA do nothing to ""civilize"" Spider during his several months with them?** I mean, they let the kid run around half-naked in a loin cloth, clearly let him re-apply his paints, and were overall... pretty nice to him despite how weirdly condescending and comfortable he was with them despite having been... you know... tortured.  I would have expected the RDA of all people to at least try to ""domesticate"" him. Cut his dreads, force him into some clothes thinking they're being ""humane"" and ""fixing"" him. He's an asset, yes, but he's also a kid. They just sort of called him feral and left it at that. Let him continue doing his thing after that. You would think that at least Quaritch, the military man, would try to put the kid in his place. It was also just really really weird seeing this teenager in a loin cloth covered in perfectly non-smudged blue paint when he'd spent so much time locked down by the present military. That would have been an interesting conflict, too, and symbolic of the RDA stripping away the Na'vi identity to ""claim"" this ""Feral child"". Also it felt like Ardmore was way too willing to give her only link to Jake Sully to Quaritch and let him go on all of these missions with them. Speaking of those missions, why did Spider actively help them and even joke around with them? 

&#x200B;

**4. Lo'ak continues to make stupid decisions and learns nothing until the very end (presumably. we don't really get to see those changes in action).** Lo'ak as a character is frustrating to watch, because he doesn't seem to have any real character arc on-screen. In the beginning of the movie, we're introduced to him as an adolescent, cocky and overconfident in his ability to both kill and not be killed by enemy soldiers, despite having no combat experience. His actions pull his brother directly into the line of fire, causing him to be injured in an explosion and to almost die on the battlefield (had he not been found and recovered by Jake). Of course, Lo'ak doesn't learn from this experience, immediately bringing his 8-year-old sister to what is quite literally an active warzone (as we know, everything outside the Hallelujah Mountains is dangerous as the RDA keep finding new ways of transportation through the jungle. He finds mysterious footprints and *decides to check it out*, knowing full well that these are enemy prints (after all, he knows they don't belong to anyone on his side). He still takes both of his sisters with him, and the human boy who is still comparatively ill-adapted to Pandora... where they are inevitably all put in danger... again. This time, held at gunpoint by the recoms. Fortunately for him, again, Jake and Neytiri dispatch these guys with ease, only losing Spider in the process. And, again, Lo'ak learns nothing from this. I don't even recall him acknowledging that they lost Spider to the recoms who were threatening to kill them earlier. He doesn't become anymore careful and is still a rebellious, backtalking edgy teen. 

Even after all of that, he continues to put himself and others in danger, whether it be following Aonung out to the reef because he doesn't know any better, to eventually leading Neteyam further into the RDA ship where he inevitably is killed. You would think that after any number of these incidents, where his life and the lives of his family were quite literally fatally threatened, that he would learn to be more cautious, or would at least develop into a more anxiety and guilt-driven character. But instead, he stays pretty consistent in his decision making, and by the time an irreversible consequence strikes, the movie is already over and we don't get to see how it impacts his character fully or his decision-making. 

&#x200B;

**5. Why did the Metkayina fully accept Jake as one of their own even after he was the whole reason for the losses they took, both of Tulkun lives and presumably Metkayina lives in the final battle?** As far as they know, this man selfishly sought out refuge with their clan because he knew he had a target on his back. He was the reason Ronal's spirit sister Roa was killed, as well as her calf. He was the reason the RDA started hunting Tulkun more aggressively and closer to the reef. He was the reason Ronal and Tonowari's children were actively endangered. He did not warn them about the threat until it was already there. He brought war to their unfortified and underprepared doorstep. And unlike with the Omaticaya, by the time he fessed up, he wasn't even able to help them devise a war-plan with his insider knowledge of the RDA. He led to numerous outside villages being burned to the ground, leaving countless Na'vi displaced from their homes. The only consequence he faces for those incidents directly are a disapproving hiss from Ronal right before he decides to sacrifice himself. Sure, Neteyam died and their only choice was to bury him in the reef, but also, is the death of someone's son directly due to the consequences of their own actions enough to forgive them for all of the pain and suffering that they have brought to your people? That all happened much too fast, in my opinion. 

&#x200B;

3. **Why do the Na'vi see Kiri as ""weird""?** And I'm not just talking about the Metkayina. They thought she had four fingers and eyebrows and wasn't purely Na'vi. They also bullied her for her forest Na'vi physiology, just like they did her brothers. No, I'm talking about *everyone*. In both the comics and her short interaction with Spider, the things that she does (admiring nature, relishing her time out in the Pandoran wildlife, her spiritual connection to all life) is seen and remarked to be ""strange"". ""I was doing that... thing again, wasn't I?"". The only issue I have with these statements, is that the things Kiri does are not all dissimilar to the things Neytiri did in the first film. Neytiri dancing through the forest, playing with those gliding lizards, looking at the atokirina with awe and admiration, thanking the leaves for holding the water she drinks. Their movements and appreciation for Pandora are very, very similar. There's a childlike wonder and a deep love for the forest and all life within it. Kiri being constantly surrounded by bioluminescent wildlife and dancing with the wind and the waves, falling asleep on the grass surrounded by the seeds of the spirit tree... what's ""strange"" about that to a Na'vi? From what we've seen, Na'vi are *very* spiritually connected to Pandora. The animals are their brothers and sisters, and the plants breathe life into the forest. Hell, in the ""Becoming One of the People"" montage from the first movie, Neytiri teaches Jake to observe nature and to appreciate every little part of the balance. Neytiri's whole mood changed to one of wonder when a seed from the spirit tree landed on her bow, a *single seed*. 

Kiri falling asleep *utterly surrounded* by atokirina should not have gotten such a joking and dismissive response from Spider, especially if he's as ""Na'vi"" as he claims to be. He grew up with the Omaticaya, playing with the children of the next Tsahik of the Omaticaya clan. Kiri most likely receives spiritual guidance from her mother to prepare her for the possibility of becoming Tsahik, but even she acts like her appreciation and connection to nature is weird and embarrassing. Even Jake dismisses her ""religious delusions"" as a symptom of Epilepsy, despite having firsthand proof of the existence of Eywa as a living being. Her gifts are only appreciated when they are actively helpful to others, like when she used the anemone to kill the RDA submarine pilots and when she used the bioluminescent fish to save Neytiri and Tuk. 

Aside from the Stephen-King-bully level side plot, Kiri had the potential to be such a compelling character, but she just felt so much more shackled by the whole ""oh she's a weirdo"" ""why am I such a weirdo"" characterization. 

&#x200B;

Also just some general, more humorous nitpicks regarding character names:

1. Spider's mom's name is Paz Socorro. Which literally translates to ""Peace"" ""Help"" (both are Portuguese nouns with direct translations). Which means that James Cameron pretty much named his RDA soldier (who took part in the burning of hometree and the assault on the tree of souls) and mother to Spider ""goodguy McGoodPerson"" 
2. Spider's name was originally Javier Socorro. I remember this very vividly because I was very interested in the character early on when the press was released around him. ""Javier"" is a Spanish spelling of the name Xavier, which roughly means ""new house"". Being the first human born on Pandora, that seems fitting. It was announced not too long before the release of the movie that his name had been changed to ""Miles"". Which... of course... immediately verified all fan theories that he was Quaritch's son. Pretty on the nose. Speaking of name meanings (James Cameron can be very deliberate with his name choices), the name Miles means ""Soldier"" OR ""Merciful"" according to some sources. 
3. Speaking of some more fun name meanings, the name ""Jake"" means ""supplanter""- definition:  supersede and replace... Funny, because he replaced his brother Tommy.  And the name Tommy means ""Twin"". And while the name Sully doesn't carry any specific meaningful definition as the other names have, the noun Sully means ""to damage the purity or integrity of; defile"", something that Jake did pretty well in the first movie. 

James Cameron and his symbolic names, everyone. I've always gotten a good laugh at Jake and Tommy Sully being called ""Twin who screws things up"" and ""guy who replaces him and screws things up"". ",1686971650.0
37,The global success of Avatar is symptomatic of our shared unconscious belief that we could all be living better and being more respectful of Nature.,4,i7w4lm,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/i7w4lm/the_global_success_of_avatar_is_symptomatic_of/,5,"I always saw people‚Äôs/the world‚Äôs universal resonance with [Avatar](https://www.avatar.com/explore/many-clans-one-heart) (to the point of it becoming #1 film in the world for almost 10 years) as a blend of **wonderment** (awe at Pandora itself), 

a subconscious sense of **pro-environmental conscience** (the awareness that we all need to be treating the planet better), 

but I think the third and biggest portion of that blend is is because it reminds of **how we we used to live** (Native Cultures),

and how in so many ways we *should* be living, for the benefit of everything: 

vastly improved physical/psychological/emotional health, 

a reconnection with spirituality (not religion, mind, but spirituality),

And a reintegration with Nature and her timeless lessons, living more empathetically with each other and towards the natural world (Flora/Fauna). 

I come from Australia, home of the oldest-recorded culture (over 10,000 years), 

and a central tenet of Aboriginal culture is the fundamental, life-long belief that the land (and everything within it) doesn‚Äôt belong to you, *you* belong to *it*. 

You‚Äôre a guest to this reality, 

and when you‚Äôre a guest somewhere, 

you (pardon the language) need to fucking behave, be polite, be gracious. In so many ways, we‚Äôre not doing that at all. 

In fact, many of us ‚Äòguests‚Äô get kicked out for misbehaving.

The Avatar films go beyond what Star Wars or Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings do ‚Äî they have a central message ‚Äî not an overly pushy one ‚Äî but a unified purpose *behind* the visual dazzlement, storytelling and lore, beyond just brand reinforcement and making money.

Entertainment and art are the single most powerful signal-boosters in our culture (a culture of storytellers, before we had schools or politics) - 

the walls come down when we‚Äôre at that proverbial campfire and, 

with our eyes wide beholding the lights and sounds, we become receptive to deeper lessons, there for us to notice and absorb, *if* we‚Äôre open to them.

The world needs Avatar‚Äôs lessons more than ever, 

Certain groups‚Äô rejection of the film is symptomatic in its own way,

of a sense of unconscious shame at what they‚Äôve been complicit in (promoting junk-food entertainment, doing nothing about the planet or to improve their lives), 

and their unwillingness for things to change for the better.

Like Eywa ‚Äòactivating‚Äô when the planet needed it most, I see the films as an extension of that. 

Maybe Pandora doesn‚Äôt exist, but I weirdly (and in a corny/sappy way, if you wanna call it that, I won‚Äôt stop you) see the folks making them as being these agents of her all-unifying will,

And the films as manifestations of what she, however far her eye is from us (or even if it exists), believes we all could benefit from ‚Äî 

the same energies that she used to make the world of Avatar itself, applied to creating these films, which will hopefully have their own cause-and-effect impact, 

Inspiring us all to live closer to the older, timeless ways.   

I for one think it‚Äôs absolutely possible ‚Äî but as Neytiri said, ‚Äòno one can teach you to see‚Äô.

You have to wake up yourself, on your own. 

You can‚Äôt be preached to or ‚Äòconverted‚Äô...the lesson needs to come from within. 

*You* need to have that awakening of conscience, on an individual level. 

And when enough people do that in a concentrated capacity ‚Äî perhaps subtly inspired by Lessons-cloaked-in-entertainment like Avatar ‚Äî 

Now that, that can seriously/potentially make a difference.",1597167303.0
38,I watched TWOW for the second time - I only have 1 wish...,5,10f9rlb,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/10f9rlb/i_watched_twow_for_the_second_time_i_only_have_1/,2,"I saw TWOW for a second time at the weekend, this time in Dolby 3D (the first time was in IMAX 3D back on release weekend). This was the first time I'd ever been to a Dolby cinema and I have to say I absolutely loved it (there are only 5 in the UK and it turns out one is pretty close to where I live!) . It's hard to say how much of a difference Dolby really makes compared to IMAX without seeing them back-to-back, but my feeling was that the Dolby 3D was marginally better and more comfortable on the eyes.

As for the film itself, I loved it the first time and I loved it just as much if not more the second time. I was slightly concerned that I wouldn't enjoy it as much the second time but that wasn't the case at all. Whatever you might think about the story, or the dialogue, or the film as a whole, I can confidently say that there is no cinema experience that comes close to watching an Avatar film in 3D. It is utterly unmatched when it comes to the level of immersion and awe. I just love being in Pandora, whether it's the jungle or the sea, and Cameron is on another level when it comes to shooting crystal clear action sequencies with stakes, emotion, invention, and *variety* (there's no endless falling skyscrapers and ""city under attack"" fatigue here. I count at least 4 different phases in the final sequence - >!the underwater chase with the mech-crabs and subs; the main attack with the Metkayina and Payakan etc; Neytiri's rage and the fight on the ship; and the sinking of the ship and subsequent escape!<).

Another thing worth mentioning is that I definitely appreciated Franglen's score more on rewatch. I think there is room for improvement with the score in the next sequels, but I do think there are moments in TWOW where the score manages to really heighten the tension. There are a couple of moments where a sort of heartbeat-like rhythm is used to great effect (>!first when Lo'ak almost drowns, and second when Jake and Neytiri are about to launch their attack right after the eclipse and Neteyam's death!<).

I only have one wish in terms of what could have been done differently in TWOW - I wish that the HFR was used for the entire film rather than having the variable frame rate. For me, the HFR looks absolutely stunning in 3D, particularly in the flying and underwater sequences. I never once experienced the ""soap opera"" effect, and even if that were to creep in if HFR is used for the more mundane scenes then that would still be preferable to the jittery effect that threatens to derail the action sequences when the frame rate is constantly switching (I experienced this is both viewings). I really hope Cameron rethinks this for the remaining sequels and sticks with HFR throughout.",1674054873.0
39,Predictions for the opening scenes of three,6,10es3df,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/10es3df/predictions_for_the_opening_scenes_of_three/,8,"3 opens with the Na'vi creation myth. According to the Na'vi, Eywa was the first living thing, but was a a hidious goddess who drifted in an empty void. So, to ease the lifelessness that surrounded her, Eywa birthed plants, animals, and the Na'vi. And gave them all connections to her, so they would never truly be alone in their games of nature. Thus was born the Time of the First Songs. 

But this time was not to last. For Eywa birthed one final child, a son called Yeyah, and he was jealous of the love the plants, animals and Na'vi had towards his mother, and sought to eradicate them all, and be an only child. He unleashed terrible volcanic eruptions across his mothers body, destroyed mountain ranges, burned forests, dried up bodies of water, and other horrific things. That was until the first Toruk Makto, and another hero known in the Na'vi language as the life bearer unified the entire moon, and defeated Yeyah, imprisoning him within Eywa's core, reversing his own birth in a weird way. But... the victory came at a heavy price. Over the years, history became legend, legend became myth, and few Na'vi today know of Yeyah. Fewer still know of the terrible price the Na'vi had to pay to achieve victory

Among those who remember, are the Yeka, a Na'vi tribe who was so awed by Yeyah's power, that they chose to join him all those years ago. Now they are considered outcasts who live in the moon's volcanic mountains, living in a Spartan like society, and awaiting the time when Yeyah will be free. We also learn that had the RDA been successful and destroyed the Tree of Souls, Yeyah would have returned.

We then fast forward thousands of centuries later and learn what has been going on since *Way of the Water*. Jake now knows that running is pointless and has decided to resume the fighting against the RDA invaders. Although it took much effort, he was able to convince the Metkayina, and other ocean tribes to join him, and now the Ocean and Forest tribes are joined up. The RDA, meanwhile, is tightening the noose. More soldiers have arrived and the fighting is growing more fierce. Additionally, the lines start to grey as the RDA begins bringing civilians from Earth to Pandora, promising them lives of luxury. But the truth is, the civilians are being imported to act as ""workers with very very very long business contracts"" with promises of vast sums of money that the RDA strangely keeps delaying.  As casualties continue to climb, the plot finally kicks off as the heroes seek to recruit more tribes and the RDA expands across Pandora, threatening tribes still unaware of what's going on. 

At the same time, Quaritch and his men are falling out of favor with the RDA who see them as useless. Their sent on a misison that their superiors believe will get them killed. While the heroes win the ensuing fight, Quaritch and his surviving men are cut off from the corporation... and meet the Yeka.",1674000314.0
40,Simon Franglen's music is not good.,6,106duc3,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/106duc3/simon_franglens_music_is_not_good/,25,"Sorry, someone's got to say it. Loved the film, but the music is just passably ok.

The few times where I felt engaged with the music in Avatar: The Way of Water was when they would re-use some of Horner's music from the first film (such as Horner's ""The Bioluminescence Of The Night"", or the ""Pure Spirits of the Forest"" cues).

In fact, any time they would use Horner's existing themes, it would remind me how there was no new themes or leitmotifs that come even close to Horner's work. Made me miss him even more so.

There is no ""Bioluminescence Of The Night"" equivalent in the Franglen's score.

There is no ""Climbing up Iknimaya"" or ""Jake's First Flight"" equivalent of majesty and awe.

Nothing that would make me go on Spotify and re-play the score the way I do with the first Avatar.

They tried. I can see they tried to recapture some of Horner's magic. But ""Into the Water"" is no ""Bioluminescence"", sorry.

It's an ok score. Very average and very unmemorable.

I know James Horner was a world-class composer and there's only a few of those in the world... and Franglen is not one of them, no matter how closely he worked with Horner on the first film.

I wish Cameron would hire Hans Zimmer or Howard Shore or Thomas Newman or someone with more experience in creating unique melodies. We need some fresh themes and melodies in the music for Avatar 3, 4, 5.

Put it this way: are you going to be happy if Avatar 3 has the same generic music with some remixes of Horner's cues from Avatar 1?

---

Edit: I just saw the film for the second time. All of my initial thoughts still stand, but I also noticed something new.

A lot of the music in the score doesn't get a chance to build on itself and expand within the scene. It feels like a bunch of short snippets of music mixed within the movie, not whole complete pieces that build on themselves and take you on an emotional journey.

Because there's so much cross-cutting between the parallel storylines, right as one musical theme gets going and we start to reach an emotional crescendo, the story switches to another character and the music abruptly shifts.

It's like you're getting close to this beautiful majestic payoff in the music, and then, boom, change of scenery, brand new vibe, totally different music. You never get to the 'orgasm' of a song.

There's a particular moment when Jake is learning how to ride the skimwing, and I can hear the music is building up to something really beautiful, this emotional crescendo that's giving me chills, and I sooo want to stay with the scene and hear the music reach that crescendo --- and then, CUT, we switch to the kids and a totally different theme.",1673165696.0
41,Such an amazing/repulsive experience watching this for the first time last night,3,zpqhei,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zpqhei/such_an_amazingrepulsive_experience_watching_this/,1,"I went to see it last night at my local theater with my mom, step dad, and brother. 

I knew my parents wanted to appease me by going in the first place. My mom truly ended up enjoying the film and was happy she came! That made me very happy because I am close to her and love when she is happy. I could tell my brother and step dad both were not into the plot very much and lacked the attention based on the sheer runtime. 

Despite all this I was amazed and thought it was spectacular. I am so happy with the plot and all the characters, except for a few villains that I thought had downright cheesy dialogue. That is of course to be expected tho. 

During some of the most emotional parts there was a large family next to me and they seemed to just get louder during these scenes. 

I will never fully feel that feeling that those scenes were designed to do because of my squirrel brain hearing chatter all around. 

Why go to a movie and talk the whole time and or mimic phrases being said? I have been to maybe 3 movies since the start of the pandemic and this is one I have been looking forward to like so many others. 

On the other hand I still felt intense feeling due to incredible visuals, soundtrack, and writing. 

Overall I was in awe with the film and will definitely go back and watch it again a couple more times by my self!",1671453525.0

if i rewatch this, what should i do for a better experience? it sounds like imax 3d is positive, but i wonder if my brain just doesn‚Äôt process 3d well. did anyone else have this experience?",1677745169.0

It is astonishingly good. The story is amazing.

44,Does anyone feel disappointed by the behaviour of the teenagers?,4,107s0ju,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/107s0ju/does_anyone_feel_disappointed_by_the_behaviour_of/,47,"I don‚Äôt buy it that Na‚Äôvi teenagers, from any tribe, would act like high school bullies from an American TV show. In the first movie we are shown that the Na‚Äôvi are extremely empathetic due to their spirituality and ability to literally feel the emotions of other people and animals through their queues. They are so unified in their respect for one another and every creature of Eywa. They even have an intense connection with their ancestors, who they pay respect to and remember at sites like the tree of voices. With such literal abilities to connect with the emotions of other life forms, and raised under such spiritual teachings, I do not believe that Na‚Äôvi teenagers would behave even remotely like human teenagers. In fact, in the first movie, the love and awe Kiri feels towards the planet are presented as the norm for Pandoran people. Through Neytiri, Jake learns about the tiny ‚Äúscents and sounds‚Äù that the Na‚Äôvi are aware of, the natural parts of their world that they appreciate in everything they do, and their instinctive kindness towards all living things. They contrast the humans in every way. However, in ‚ÄòThe Way of Water,‚Äô all this is forgotten. Kiri is painted as weird for appreciating nature and getting distracted by its beauty. The boys of the Metkayina tribe bully her over it. The only connection they seem to have with nature is through their tulkun ‚Äúsoul brothers/soul sisters.‚Äù Other than that, they act just like rowdy human teenagers with a love of the waves. They‚Äôre just malapert surfer boys. Believing in the ways of Eywa doesn‚Äôt require faith on Pandora. They feel her power and interact with others through her. I simply don‚Äôt believe that such a deeply emotionally and spiritually evolved species such as the Na‚Äôvi would behave exactly like human TV clich√©s as teenagers.

I‚Äôd like to be very clear that I am not under the belief that the Na‚Äôvi have no capacity for violence or ruthlessness. They are tribal warriors, after all. I just think that the cringeworthy stereotypical behaviour and talk of TV high school teens does not align with the culture of the Na‚Äôvi.",1673302791.0
45,Silly question. But why did some scenes in TWOW appear to jitter or have worse visual effects?,3,zxgry1,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/zxgry1/silly_question_but_why_did_some_scenes_in_twow/,4,"Just got out of seeing The Way of Water, and for the most part, I was in awe of the visual spectacle of the film. But it looked like some scenes were significantly worse than others. In particular, the akula attack scene with Lo‚Äôak, some boat crashes during the final battle, and a lot of rainy scenes appeared to be jumpy or jittery looking. 

Anybody else feel this way? Are these simply just examples of scenes that didn‚Äôt have as much time available for animators to perfect?",1672251686.0
46,Kiri doesn't need to breathe underwater (with receipts this time),1,12u58wm,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/12u58wm/kiri_doesnt_need_to_breathe_underwater_with/,6,"Since my previous post was removed, I guess I gotta try again with some evidence.  


ETA: Alright, guess I have to plead my case. This is obviously a stretch, but hear me out please, here we go:

&#x200B;

(1) during their first swim after they get accepted to stay at the village, when the kids jump in they all react to needing air, Lo'ak especially is the most animated with cheeks visibly puffed, strong bubbles coming out, clearly nervous and struggling, Neteyam is more calm, but still with lips closed and pursed, Tuk is of course more playful with a slight smile but back to close lips soon after. Kiri on the other hand is mouth agape, smiling at Eywa's wonder, no bubbles at all coming out of her mouth, no puffed cheeks, no signs of struggle to even swim at whatever depth she wants; the boys try to follow the Metkayina kids, exhaling bubbles, swimming with effort, lips closed and pursed. Even the Metkayina kids have their mouths closed for the most part, except when Tsireya smiles twice, but they literally learn to do this as babies. Tuk has to stay closer to the surface, assumably because she isn't strong enough to keep up even with her brothers, and all three of them surface to gasp for air and breathe at this point. Meanwhile Kiri is exploring the depths, mouth in a massive smile, wide open, no bubbles. The boys try to keep up again underwater and again have to surface for air, then the Metkayina kids talk amongst themselves underwater before joining the other kids above when Roxto asks where Kiri is, visibly confused she isn't there. All the while, Kiri is exploring the reef, to the floor at this point, no bubbles, no effort, no puffed cheeks, mouth wide open, smile wide, no visible need or care for air. 

&#x200B;

(2) the next scene with all of the kids (except Kiri) is them near the shore when Ao'nung calls the ilu and Tsireya teaches Lo'ak how to ride. Where is Kiri? Sitting on her knees on the ocean floor, arms wide open, in awe of herself. This is the first time we see her mouth even closed underwater, and yet still no bubbles come out, no pursed lips, no puffing cheeks, no urgency to surface.

&#x200B;

(3) the ilu interaction - when it comes up to Kiri for the first time is when she is on her knees in the above scene and it immediately exhales air bubbles, and even looks to be curious (in my brain during my 1st viewing I was thinking that the ilu was like, ""why can she breathe?"") When it comes up to Kiri it does so so lovingly, almost with recognition, to me it almost felt like a \*motherly\* reunion, or even that of a twin flame or reflection; this is connected to my theory that Kiri is Eywa incarnate (at least in some form, entirely, partially, avatar, Pandora recom, or otherwise)

&#x200B;

(4) When Tsireya teaches them about the gill wings and Kiri is wearing one just playing with the gold fish, I think she initially put it on right after Tuk in the previous scene just to fit in and not draw more attention to herself, but she gets bored and ends up playing with the gold fish, which the Tsahik realizes as strange and I am sure which think would be doubly strange were she doing it without the gill wings on too....

&#x200B;

(5) next scene is her literally laying in the shallows staring at a creature's hold waiting for it to emerge just for the fun of it, laying there at least long enough for the \*Metkayina\* kids to think that it was strange (apart from her ""looking at nothing,"" as if Eywa is nothing, psh)

&#x200B;

(6) She has a seizure underwater because she asked herself who her father was when she was an immaculate conception of her own creation, (system crash) not because she can't breathe underwater; but the seizure did force water into her lungs since it happened while she was underwater

&#x200B;

(7) I'll end here, because it's so so fitting to end on #7 for this: Kiri connecting to the spirit tree again is going to be a pivotal thing for some reason, primarily because Norm explicitly says she can't do it again. For me, this is the weirdest part of the movie, because it does my man Norm so wrong. This dude studied the Na'vi language and culture for YEARS to come to Pandora for his science and such, he schooled Jake and others on the spiritual importance of certain things in their culture and emphasized how their bonds to each other, the animals, Eywa, their ancestors, etc. is what made them them, it is what made them whole, and that severing that connection could literally kill them. For him to be reduced in Way of Water to basically the antithesis of that by saying that Kiri, the literal incarnation of Eywa, can't connect to the spirit tree again, is just so so wrong to me. It felt so weird for that to be his role in the film. Foreshadowing Kiri connecting again and potentially something devastating happening",1682088835.0
47,how to bring Peace to Pandora,0,1adak0w,Avatar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avatar/comments/1adak0w/how_to_bring_peace_to_pandora/,4,"In an unexpected turn of events, former President Donald Trump found himself on the lush and vibrant moon of Pandora. With his signature confidence, he stepped into the diplomatic arena, aiming to broker a deal between the indigenous Na'vi and the resource-hungry RDA Corporation.

Trump, in his distinctive manner, approached the Na'vi leaders with a hearty handshake and a declaration that ""this deal is going to be tremendous, believe me!"" He praised their unity and connection with nature, calling it ""the best way to live.""

Turning to the RDA representatives, he commended their entrepreneurial spirit, stating, ""You guys know how to make things happen, big league! But we gotta find a win-win here.""

Employing his art of the deal, Trump proposed a compromise that would benefit both sides. ""We'll build the best infrastructure for the Na'vi, and in return, the RDA gets access to some of Pandora's resources. It's a beautiful deal, folks!""

To seal the agreement, Trump threw in a classic line, saying, ""It's a win for the Na'vi, it's a win for the RDA, it's a win for me, and it's a win for Pandora!"" The Na'vi leaders were intrigued, and even the RDA executives found themselves nodding in agreement.

As news of Trump's successful negotiation spread across Pandora, the inhabitants from both sides praised his deal-making skills. The Na'vi danced in celebration, and the RDA toasted to the new era of cooperation.

In the end, Donald Trump left Pandora with a sense of accomplishment, leaving behind a legacy of unity and a deal that would be remembered as one of the most unexpected turns in interplanetary diplomacy.

Amid the bioluminescent glow of Pandora, Donald Trump's arrival created a stir among the Na'vi and the RDA executives. The Na'vi leaders, including Neytiri, and the RDA brass, like Colonel Miles Quaritch, eyed him cautiously as he entered the diplomatic tent.

Trump, undeterred by the skeptical gazes, flashed his signature grin and extended his hand to Neytiri, saying, ""You're fantastic, Neytiri, just fantastic! Beautiful people you have here. We're going to make a deal that's going to be the best, believe me!""

Neytiri, curious yet reserved, replied, ""Our connection with Eywa is strong, Mr. Trump. What can your deal offer that aligns with our ways?""

Trump, ever the negotiator, assured her, ""We're going to build the best infrastructure for you, Neytiri. Your people will thrive, and you'll have the best of both worlds. I know deals, and this one will be tremendous.""

Meanwhile, Colonel Quaritch observed the proceedings with a stern expression. Trump approached him confidently, acknowledging the military prowess of the RDA. ""Colonel, you've got the best forces here. We're going to make sure your people are taken care of, and we'll have an agreement that benefits everyone.""

The negotiations continued, with Trump using his charisma and familiar catchphrases to bridge the gap. ""We're going to drain the swamp here, folks, and create a win-win situation for both sides!""

As the deal unfolded, key characters from the Na'vi and RDA, such as Jake Sully and Grace Augustine, found themselves nodding in agreement. Jake, impressed by the unexpected turn of events, remarked, ""I didn't see this coming, but if it brings peace, I'm all for it.""

Grace, usually critical of human intentions, admitted, ""Well, he does have a way of making things happen. Let's hope this deal truly benefits Pandora and its inhabitants.""

In the end, as the Na'vi and RDA leaders embraced the terms, Trump basked in the praise. Neytiri expressed gratitude, ""Your deal respects our ways, and we appreciate the effort for a shared future.""

Even Colonel Quaritch, known for his tough stance, gruffly admitted, ""I didn't think it was possible, but you got the job done, Trump.""

Trump's unorthodox diplomacy had indeed united the moon's inhabitants in a way no one expected. As he departed, both Na'vi and RDA personnel found themselves acknowledging that, against all odds, Trump had accomplished something truly remarkable ‚Äì bringing peace to Pandora.

In the wake of the unprecedented peace deal on Pandora, Donald Trump's entrepreneurial spirit kicked into high gear. With a broad smile, he declared, ""We're not just making a deal, folks. We're building something tremendous right here!""

Trump Tower Pandora became the talk of the moon. Rising amidst the towering Hometrees, the gleaming structure combined modern luxury with Na'vi-inspired design. Trump, in his typical flair, announced, ""It's going to be the best tower, believe me. Na'vi-inspired decor, top-notch facilities ‚Äì they've never seen anything like it.""

Neytiri, amused by the concept, found herself intrigued. ""Your towers are unique, Mr. Trump. We hope they coexist harmoniously with our Hometrees.""

Trump assured her, ""Absolutely, Neytiri! It's going to be a beautiful blend of human and Na'vi culture. The best of both worlds!""

As construction began, the Na'vi watched in awe as the tower took shape. The RDA, too, saw the economic potential and eagerly joined the project. Even Colonel Quaritch, skeptical at first, couldn't deny the allure of a Trump Tower on Pandora.

Meanwhile, Trump, being an avid golfer, saw an opportunity to leave his mark on Pandora in another way ‚Äì a state-of-the-art golf course. With a grin, he declared, ""We're going to have the best golf course, folks. Imagine teeing off under the glow of Pandora's moons ‚Äì it's going to be fantastic!""

Jake Sully, who had embraced the idea of unity, found himself chuckling at the unexpected turn of events. ""Never thought we'd see a golf course on Pandora, but if it helps everyone get along, why not?""

Grace Augustine, always a voice of reason, quipped, ""Well, if we're going to have a golf course, let's make sure it's environmentally friendly, Mr. Trump.""

Trump, ever the showman, replied, ""Grace, it's going to be the greenest golf course you've ever seen ‚Äì eco-friendly and tremendous!""

In the end, Trump Tower Pandora and the golf course became symbols of the newfound collaboration between the Na'vi and the RDA. The inhabitants, once wary, found themselves enjoying the amenities and, in a surprising twist, even participating in inter-species golf tournaments.

He left behind a legacy not just of diplomacy but also of unexpected humor and unity. The Na'vi, RDA, and even the local wildlife found themselves sharing laughter on the golf course, proving that sometimes, in the most unexpected places, a touch of humor can bridge the gaps between worlds.",1706469576.0
